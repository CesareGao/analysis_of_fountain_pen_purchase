                                    The TWSBI ECO fountain pen boasts an incredible value with its piston filling system and affordable price. Like many other TWSBI fountain pens, it features a crystal clear acrylic barrel so you can see your ink level, and a clear cap. The pen cap has an inner cap to ensure a perfect seal when stored away. It is completed with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib. TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This clear demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

                                    The TWSBI Diamond 580 comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. The clear demonstrator barrel allows you to see your ink color and remaining ink level. It has a clear grip section and screw-cap. It comes with a stainless steel nib and is presented in a modern clear display. The idea behind the TWSBI Diamond 580 was to go back to basics and capture the simplicity and elegance of traditional writing instruments. In recent years, the development and modernization of writing instruments has resulted in traditional writing instruments, such as fountain pens, falling into obscurity. It was TWSBI's goal to bring the past back to life by creating a traditional fountain pen that even modern day society can appreciate. The TWSBI Diamond 580 is a classic fountain pen with a piston ink-filling system. By fusing the traditional mechanisms of the fountain pen with a modern industrial design, TWSBI has created an eye-catching fountain pen that is simultaneously appreciative of the past and relevant in the present. TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

                                    The TWSBI Diamond 580AL comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. The clear demonstrator barrel allows you to see your ink color and remaining ink level. It has a silver aluminum grip section and screw-cap. It comes with a stainless steel nib and is presented in a modern clear display. The idea behind the TWSBI Diamond 580 was to go back to basics and capture the simplicity and elegance of traditional writing instruments. In recent years, the development and modernization of writing instruments has resulted in traditional writing instruments, such as fountain pens, falling into obscurity. It was TWSBI's goal to bring the past back to life by creating a traditional fountain pen that even modern day society can appreciate. The TWSBI Diamond 580 is a classic fountain pen with a piston ink-filling system. By fusing the traditional mechanisms of the fountain pen with a modern industrial design, TWSBI has created an eye-catching fountain pen that is simultaneously appreciative of the past and relevant in the present. TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

                                    This clear Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.

As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!

Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water.

                                    The TWSBI Vac700R comes with a vacuum filler mechanism. This fountain pen features a clear demonstrator body with a stainless steel nib. The Vac700 has been updated to now be called the Vac700R. TWSBI made small updates to the internal of the pen valving. The old Vac700 used to have 2 small valves. Now, it has only 1 large valve. The bottom of the grip/feeder section has also been enlarged and tapered more drastically. They found by doing these two adjustments, the flow of the pen when the end cap is open increased a small percentage. This is the same design they incorporated in the Vac Mini series. Due to the bottom of the grip/feeder section being enlarged and tapered differently, the individual nib sets from the original Vac700 pen will NOT work on the Vac700R. Only the Vac700R nib sets will go along with the Vac700R fountain pen. TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.If you're taking apart this pen, note that the mechanism on the Vac700R removes out of the pen in a counter-clockwise direction. This is the opposite direction from other TWSBI pens like the 580.

This LAMY LX (""Luxe"") fountain pen features a body made from rose gold colored double-anodized aluminum, a gold-coated clip, a translucent grey triangular grip section, and a black glossy interchangeable steel nib. There are lot of subtle details on the LX as an enhancement over the similar AL-Star model, including matching metal accents on the cap end and barrel end with a shiny diamond polish, a glossy LAMY logo on the barrel, and the laser engraving on the nib. While slightly different in appearance than the other LAMY steel nibs, they are indeed swappable as well. This pen comes with a matching rose gold-colored anodized aluminum pen case. It also comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge so you can get started writing right away. If you'd like to use bottled fountain pen ink, you can also purchase a LAMY Z28 converter. Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.

                                    The Noodler's Konrad flex pen is smaller than the Ahab, but larger than the Nib Creaper. This clear fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!
While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

The Pilot Falcon (previously known as the Namiki Falcon) is an iconic pen in the fountain pen world. It is most famous for its rhodium-plated 14k gold soft nib, which provides line variation when you change your writing pressure. This solid black fountain pen has rhodium trim and includes a Con-40 converter and a Pilot/Namiki ink cartridge, packaged in a Pilot gift box. The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. Pilot doesn't advertise this as a ""flex"" pen, though it has that reputation in the fountain pen community. It most certainly provides distinct line variation, though you can overdo it, so just be cognizant of how far you're pushing it when you flex the nib tines.  The soft extra-fine nib is quite fine, and has a very toothy feel to it though it does provide the most dramatic line variation of all the nib options. The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs. Pilot (and other Japanese nib companies) has a reputation for grinding their nibs finer than European brands. We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs. The Falcon is made of black resin, a light material that polishes to a high gloss. The pen is trimmed with polished gold accents, which really complement the black color nicely. The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers.  This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.

                                    The TWSBI Mini comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. Like many other TWSBI fountain pens, it features a crystal clear acrylic barrel so you can see your ink level, and a solid black cap. It is completed with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib.
TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

The Pilot Falcon (previously known as the Namiki Falcon) is an iconic pen in the fountain pen world. It is most famous for its 14k gold soft nib, which provides line variation when you change your writing pressure. This solid black fountain pen has gold trim and includes a Con-40 converter and a Pilot/Namiki ink cartridge, packaged in a Pilot gift box.
The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. Pilot doesn't advertise this as a ""flex"" pen, though it has that reputation in the fountain pen community. It most certainly provides distinct line variation, though you can overdo it, so just be cognizant of how far you're pushing it when you flex the nib tines. 
The soft extra-fine nib is quite fine, and has a very toothy feel to it though it does provide the most dramatic line variation of all the nib options. The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs. Pilot (and other Japanese nib companies) has a reputation for grinding their nibs finer than European brands. We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs.
The Falcon is made of black resin, a light material that polishes to a high gloss. The pen is trimmed with polished gold accents, which really complement the black color nicely. The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers. 
This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly.
While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.

The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a “Toledo, Ohio” engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This blue and white Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a “Toledo, Ohio” engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This blue Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

                                    The TWSBI ECO fountain pen boasts an incredible value with its piston filling system and affordable price. Like many other TWSBI fountain pens, it features a crystal clear acrylic barrel so you can see your ink level, and a translucent blue cap and piston knob. The pen cap has an inner cap to ensure a perfect seal when stored away. It is completed with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib. This color is a limited production run.TWSBI’s belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a “Toledo, Ohio” engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This solid black Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a “Toledo, Ohio” engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.
In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a “Toledo, Ohio” engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

A Goulet exclusive, limited edition color!
The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a “Toledo, Ohio” engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. This beautiful turquoise fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It is complemented with silver trim and comes with a silver #6 steel nib. Each pen is individually numbered out of 1898.In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience! The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size. This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This white and black Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

This white and black Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.  The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.  As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!  Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

The pen cap has an inner cap to ensure a perfect seal when stored away. It is completed with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib. This color is a limited production run.TWSBI’s belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

                                    The TWSBI Classic comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. Similar length but slimmer than its sister pen, the Diamond 580. This fountain pen has a glossy black finish with an ink window and a stainless steel nib. It unscrews to open and the cap posts onto the barrel.
TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.
Warning: this pen should not be cleaned with any form of alcohol or acetone, or it will break down the plastic used in the pen.

                                    The TWSBI Diamond 580ALR comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. The clear demonstrator barrel allows you to see your ink color and remaining ink level. It has a silver aluminum grip section and screw-cap. The aluminum is enhanced with a subtle matte finish, and circular engravings in the grip and cap area. It comes with a stainless steel nib and is presented in a modern clear display.  The idea behind the TWSBI Diamond 580 was to go back to basics and capture the simplicity and elegance of traditional writing instruments. In recent years, the development and modernization of writing instruments has resulted in traditional writing instruments, such as fountain pens, falling into obscurity. It was TWSBI's goal to bring the past back to life by creating a traditional fountain pen that even modern day society can appreciate. The TWSBI Diamond 580 is a classic fountain pen with a piston ink-filling system. By fusing the traditional mechanisms of the fountain pen with a modern industrial design, TWSBI has created an eye-catching fountain pen that is simultaneously appreciative of the past and relevant in the present. TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance.

Like many other TWSBI fountain pens, it features a crystal clear acrylic barrel so you can see your ink level, and a clear cap. It is enhanced with a silver aluminum grip section and piston mechanism. It is completed with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib.
TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a “Toledo, Ohio” engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This translucent turquoise demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

This LAMY LX (""Luxe"") fountain pen features a body made from ruthenium-colored double-anodized aluminum, a ruthenium-coated clip, a translucent grey triangular grip section, and a black glossy interchangeable steel nib. There are lot of subtle details on the LX as an enhancement over the similar AL-Star model, including matching metal accents on the cap end and barrel end with a shiny diamond polish, a glossy LAMY logo on the barrel, and the laser engraving on the nib. While slightly different in appearance than the other LAMY steel nibs, they are indeed swappable as well. This pen comes with a matching ruthenium-colored anodized aluminum pen case. It also comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge so you can get started writing right away. If you'd like to use bottled fountain pen ink, you can also purchase a LAMY Z28 converter.

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This translucent blue demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

This yellow and orange Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.  The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.  As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!  Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The pen cap has an inner cap to ensure a perfect seal when stored away. It is completed with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib. This color is a limited production run.TWSBI’s belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This pearlescent white Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

                                    The TWSBI Vac Mini is a slightly shorter version of the Vac700R. This clear demonstrator fountain pen fills via a vacuum filler mechanism, has translucent grey accents on the grip and piston knob, and has a stainless steel nib.
TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

                                    The TWSBI Classic comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. Similar length but slimmer than its sister pen, the Diamond 580. This fountain pen has a glossy blue finish with an ink window and a stainless steel nib. It unscrews to open and the cap posts onto the barrel.
TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.
Warning: this pen should not be cleaned with any form of alcohol or acetone, or it will break down the plastic used in the pen.

The Noodler's Konrad flex pen is smaller than the Ahab, but larger than the Nib Creaper. This grey swirly acrylic resin fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad Acrylic is made of acrylic acetate. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues! While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

This green and white Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.  The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.  As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!  Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

                                    The TWSBI Classic comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. Similar length but slimmer than its sister pen, the Diamond 580. This fountain pen has a glossy burgundy finish with an ink window and a stainless steel nib. It unscrews to open and the cap posts onto the barrel.
TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.
Warning: this pen should not be cleaned with any form of alcohol or acetone, or it will break down the plastic used in the pen.

This TWSBI Precision fountain pen has an aluminum body and grip with stainless steel trim. It is equipped with a stainless steel nib. Like all TWSBIs, it comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts.
It uses the same nib as the TWSBI Diamond 580; however the 580 nib unit itself is not compatible in the Precision. Only the nib is swappable. TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance.

                                    This black Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.

As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!

Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

Designed after the astronomical light-shows that our galaxy displays, the Invincia Nebula features a distinct multi-colored plating finish, displaying a blend of metallic blues, purples, and reds. The sophistication of the trim, clip and nib in stark black contrasted with that of the barrel and cap, the Nebula is the most alluring Invincia yet. The Nebula is Monteverde’s most technologically challenging Invincia collection, blending art and technology for a perfect balance between high-tech materials and classic styling. Latin for ""fog"", a nebula is an interstellar cloud of various gases and ultraviolet radiation emitted from nearby stars that creates a wide spectrum of color and is truly a sight to behold. Made from solid brass and assembled by hand, this mid-weight pen is ergonomically balanced and is comfortable to hold, perfect for daily writing. It has a matching black #6 steel nib to complement the black trim, and fills via standard international ink cartridges or converter (included).

We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience! The Bock nib does not have an imprint to note the nib size.

                                    The TWSBI ECO-T fountain pen boasts an incredible value with its piston filling system and affordable price. Like many other TWSBI fountain pens, it features a crystal clear acrylic barrel so you can see your ink level, and a clear cap. The pen cap has an inner cap to ensure a perfect seal when stored away. It is completed with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib. The ECO-T differs from the ECO in that it has a triangular grip section for ease of holding the pen, and triangular shaped cap and piston knob instead of hexagon. TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This orange Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a “Toledo, Ohio” engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.
In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This green Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The new Conklin Herringbone series combines the vintage appeal with modern bold style and elegance. The unique Herringbone pattern itself is achieved by using a very precise computerized engraving machine to cut the deep pattern on airplane-grade aluminum. This elegant pattern, reminiscent of the Conklin crescent shape, is seen underneath a special translucent colored acrylic and coated with several layers of epoxy for protection and brightness. The heavy chromium clip also is engraved with the legendary “Conklin” trademarked name and font and the center ring is engraved with the Conklin “Herringbone” name surrounded by several Conklin crescent shapes on each side. This fountain pen comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable short standard international cartridges. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This pearlescent blue Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Pilot Falcon (previously known as the Namiki Falcon) is an iconic pen in the fountain pen world. It is most famous for its rhodium-plated 14k gold soft nib, which provides line variation when you change your writing pressure. This solid red fountain pen has rhodium trim and includes a Con-40 converter and a Pilot/Namiki ink cartridge, packaged in a Pilot gift box. The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. Pilot doesn't advertise this as a ""flex"" pen, though it has that reputation in the fountain pen community. It most certainly provides distinct line variation, though you can overdo it, so just be cognizant of how far you're pushing it when you flex the nib tines.  The soft extra-fine nib is quite fine, and has a very toothy feel to it though it does provide the most dramatic line variation of all the nib options. The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs. Pilot (and other Japanese nib companies) has a reputation for grinding their nibs finer than European brands. We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs. The Falcon is made of black resin, a light material that polishes to a high gloss. The pen is trimmed with polished gold accents, which really complement the black color nicely. The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers.  This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This purple Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

This LAMY LX (""Luxe"") fountain pen features a body made from gold colored double-anodized aluminum, a gold-coated clip, a translucent grey triangular grip section, and a black glossy interchangeable steel nib. There are lot of subtle details on the LX as an enhancement over the similar AL-Star model, including matching metal accents on the cap end and barrel end with a shiny diamond polish, a glossy LAMY logo on the barrel, and the laser engraving on the nib. While slightly different in appearance than the other LAMY steel nibs, they are indeed swappable as well. This pen comes with a matching gold-colored anodized aluminum pen case. It also comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge so you can get started writing right away. If you'd like to use bottled fountain pen ink, you can also purchase a LAMY Z28 converter.
Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.

                                    This translucent turquoise blue demonstrator Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.

As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!

Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

This LAMY LX (""Luxe"") fountain pen features a body made from palladium-colored double-anodized aluminum, a palladium-coated clip, a translucent grey triangular grip section, and a black glossy interchangeable steel nib. There are lot of subtle details on the LX as an enhancement over the similar AL-Star model, including matching metal accents on the cap end and barrel end with a shiny diamond polish, a glossy LAMY logo on the barrel, and the laser engraving on the nib. While slightly different in appearance than the other LAMY steel nibs, they are indeed swappable as well. This pen comes with a matching palladium-colored anodized aluminum pen case. It also comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge so you can get started writing right away. If you'd like to use bottled fountain pen ink, you can also purchase a LAMY Z28 converter.
Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This grey and red Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

This newly re-released Stipula Passaporto is a tiny pocket-sized fountain pen that fills via eyedropper only. This transparent clear fountain pen has a silver stainless steel nib and matching silver trim. It comes with an eyedropper, for easy filling from your favorite bottled ink, as well as two sample vials of green and turquoise blue ink.As with any eyedropper pen, air pressure plays a larger role in its functionality than in other pens with smaller ink reservoirs. As such, you may experience leaking or burping if the pressure is compromised by conditions such as rapid temperature fluctuations, impact, or vibration. To minimize this, consider applying a small amount of silicone grease to the pen’s threads to create an additional seal.

﻿This item is on closeout and we will not be restocking once sold out; all sales are final.

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This translucent green demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

                                    The TWSBI Diamond 580AL comes with a benchmark piston ink-filling mechanism and has all detachable parts. The clear demonstrator barrel allows you to see your ink color and remaining ink level. This special edition fountain pen has a green aluminum grip section and screw-cap. It comes with a stainless steel nib and is presented in a modern clear display. The idea behind the TWSBI Diamond 580 was to go back to basics and capture the simplicity and elegance of traditional writing instruments. In recent years, the development and modernization of writing instruments has resulted in traditional writing instruments, such as fountain pens, falling into obscurity. It was TWSBI's goal to bring the past back to life by creating a traditional fountain pen that even modern day society can appreciate. The TWSBI Diamond 580 is a classic fountain pen with a piston ink-filling system. By fusing the traditional mechanisms of the fountain pen with a modern industrial design, TWSBI has created an eye-catching fountain pen that is simultaneously appreciative of the past and relevant in the present. TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

Crafted from high-grade, hand-made European resins, the Conklin All American is impressively large in size, yet not so big as to be uncomfortable in the hand. The screw cap and barrel are carefully tapered to provide a nice balance. The trademark Rocker Clip allows users to easily secure the pen to a shirt or coat pocket. The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a #6 steel nib.The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design.We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Noodler's Konrad flex pen is smaller than the Ahab, but larger than the Nib Creaper. This white and black fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues! While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This green Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Opus 88 Demonstrator fountain pen is truly unique writing instrument. This large non-postable pen is a eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. Featuring a sharp alternating material scheme of frosted and clear resin, this pen’s design stands on its own. It has a sleek black clip and a silver stainless steel #6 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity. Having a completely clear pen body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.

Crafted from high-grade, hand-made European resins, the Conklin All American is impressively large in size, yet not so big as to be uncomfortable in the hand. The screw cap and barrel are carefully tapered to provide a nice balance. The trademark Rocker Clip allows users to easily secure the pen to a shirt or coat pocket. The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a #6 steel nib in black.The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009.

                                    This pearlescent white Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.

As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!

Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This translucent yellow demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

The new Conklin Herringbone series combines the vintage appeal with modern bold style and elegance. The unique Herringbone pattern itself is achieved by using a very precise computerized engraving machine to cut the deep pattern on airplane-grade aluminum. This elegant pattern, reminiscent of the Conklin crescent shape, is seen underneath a special translucent colored acrylic and coated with several layers of epoxy for protection and brightness. The heavy chromium clip also is engraved with the legendary “Conklin” trademarked name and font and the center ring is engraved with the Conklin “Herringbone” name surrounded by several Conklin crescent shapes on each side. This fountain pen comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable short standard international cartridges. It comes with a #6 steel nib.We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

                                    This translucent orange demonstrator Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.

As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!

Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

The Pilot Metal Falcon is a metal version of the very popular Falcon series. Slightly larger and heavier than the resin Falcon, this black fountain pen pen has a soft rhodium-plated 14k gold nib that will give you line variation as you change your writing pressure. The slightly longer body has enough room to accommodate the included Pilot Con-70 converter, giving you greater ink capacity for longer writing sessions. You can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges or any other Pilot converter.
The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. The finish of the Metal Falcon is a gloss lacquer, with a sparkly metallic color that catches the light in a subtle, yet very impressive way. The pen is trimmed with polished rhodium accents, which really complement the black color well. 
This is a slightly heavier pen than most at 33g, a noticeable difference from the lighter resin version of the Falcon. It's well-balanced though, even posted. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Metal Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's build quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.

The Noodler's Konrad flex pen is smaller than the Ahab, but larger than the Nib Creaper. This blue fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues! While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This pink Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

                                    This translucent blue demonstrator Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.

The new Conklin Herringbone series combines the vintage appeal with modern bold style and elegance. The unique Herringbone pattern itself is achieved by using a very precise computerized engraving machine to cut the deep pattern on airplane-grade aluminum. This elegant pattern, reminiscent of the Conklin crescent shape, is seen underneath a special translucent colored acrylic and coated with several layers of epoxy for protection and brightness. The heavy chromium clip also is engraved with the legendary “Conklin” trademarked name and font and the center ring is engraved with the Conklin “Herringbone” name surrounded by several Conklin crescent shapes on each side. This fountain pen comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable short standard international cartridges. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

                                    This translucent yellow demonstrator Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.

As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!

Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

Crafted from high-grade, hand-made European resins, the Conklin All American is impressively large in size, yet not so big as to be uncomfortable in the hand. The screw cap and barrel are carefully tapered to provide a nice balance. The trademark Rocker Clip allows users to easily secure the pen to a shirt or coat pocket. The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a #6 steel nib.The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design.We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Noodler's Konrad flex pen is smaller than the Ahab, but larger than the Nib Creaper. This translucent yellow fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues! While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This pearlescent orange Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This green Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

Crafted from high-grade, hand-made European resins, the Conklin All American is impressively large in size, yet not so big as to be uncomfortable in the hand. The screw cap and barrel are carefully tapered to provide a nice balance. The trademark Rocker Clip allows users to easily secure the pen to a shirt or coat pocket. The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a silver #6 steel nib.The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design.We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The pen cap has an inner cap to ensure a perfect seal when stored away. It is completed with silver trim and a silver stainless steel nib.

These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.

The Noodler's Konrad flex pen is smaller than the Ahab, but larger than the Nib Creaper. This red and black acrylic resin fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad Acrylic is made of acrylic acetate. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues! While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Noodler's Konrad flex pen is smaller than the Ahab, but larger than the Nib Creaper. This translucent green fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues! While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

﻿Special Offer! ﻿This pen comes with a FREE Visconti Dreamtouch Leather 2-Pen Case (retail value $100) as well as a FREE Visconti Traveling Inkwell (retail value $70). 
The Visconti Limited Edition Opera Master Luna features a gorgeous ""Goulet blue"" resin infused with silver sparkles. This Opera Master Luna will be sold exclusively by Goulet Pens and is limited to only 188 total fountain pens, each individually numbered. It uses an oversized 23kt palladium nib, and fills via the double reservoir power filler. It comes in a large, beautiful leather pen box, along with a glass ink bottle filled with Visconti Blue ink. In 1998, Visconti applied for the Italian patent for its Double Reservoir Power Filler, a unique filling system that allows a massive ink capacity and safe usage during air flights. Similar in operation to vacuum-filling pens (such as the larger Visconti Homo Sapiens), the Opera Master fills with a 3.4ml ink capacity in the sealed ink reservoir. Unique to this design, there is a second reservoir in between the vacuum seal and the pen’s feed that holds about .6ml, the size of a typical standard international short cartridge. Effectively, what you end up with here is the ink equivalent of a standard international cartridge that you can use to write (without having to unscrew the filler knob like you do with most other vacuum-fillers), with the contents of an entire pack of cartridges (or the entire Visconti Traveling Inkwell!) in the back of your pen. You can also customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This pearlescent purple Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

The Homo Sapiens is handmade from hardened basaltic lava sourced from the Mount Etna volcano in Italy, with a trim made of solid bronze. Visconti lava is virtually unbreakable, comfortable and warm to the touch - and slightly hygroscopic, absorbing moisture from your hand. The pen caps using the Visconti 'Hook Safe Lock', a revolutionary capping system so you can cap a pen without worrying about the cap accidentally unscrewing in your pocket and leaking. The fountain pen's vacuum power filler is made of titanium to resist ink corrosion, and it features a rose gold-plated oversized 23k Palladium Dreamtouch nib to match the trim color. You can also customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.

This should resolve most ink flow issues! While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.

This pearlescent blue Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.  The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.  As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!  Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

The Noodler's Konrad flex pen is smaller than the Ahab, but larger than the Nib Creaper. This red acrylic resin fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad Acrylic is made of acrylic acetate. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues! While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

This green and black Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.  The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.

It has a built-in slide piston mechanism for use with bottled ink.The Neponset is a glimpse back in time to an era of legacies and war heroes. The New England Airship company, later renamed the Dartmouth Airship Co., the first of its kind in the United States, had a new CEO during a challenging time for our country. During the year of 1929 Nathan’s grandfather became CEO and one year later christened a new airship named the Neponset.The shape of the Neponset pen is similar to the dirigible and is constructed of the original fountain pen material ebonite, which was vulcanized in 1844 by Charles Goodyear in Massachusetts whose company built the Neponset airship.The Neponset is fitted with a three tined music nib, the ""Vishnu Victory"" nib in honor of the 2.5 million World War II allied soldiers of India as well as the reference to the source for the ebonite used in the pen and the original Neponset Blimp.

The Pilot Metal Falcon is a metal version of the very popular Falcon series. Slightly larger and heavier than the resin Falcon, this pale blue fountain pen pen has a soft rhodium-plated 14k gold nib that will give you line variation as you change your writing pressure. The slightly longer body has enough room to accommodate the included Pilot Con-70 converter, giving you greater ink capacity for longer writing sessions. You can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges or any other Pilot converter.
The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. The finish of the Metal Falcon is a gloss lacquer, with a sparkly metallic color that catches the light in a subtle, yet very impressive way. The pen is trimmed with polished rhodium accents. 
This is a slightly heavier pen than most at 33g, a noticeable difference from the lighter resin version of the Falcon. It's well-balanced though, even posted. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Metal Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's build quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.

This Montegrappa Fortuna fountain pen features a copper barrel with brushed stainless steel accents, creating an elegant yet modern look. The pen features a super smooth steel nib, and accepts cartridges or a converter (included). The copper will patina on the pen over time (unless polished - cloth included), creating a unique look to you. Since 1912, for more than a century, Montegrappa has been manufacturing high-quality writing instruments in the same historic building in Bassano del Grappa, North East Italy. Within a stone’s throw of the Montegrappa works – home of the oldest pen manufacture in Italy – is the heart of another industry. Grappa is the local tipple, and it has never been more popular, finding new friends in bars and saloons from Mumbai to Manhattan to Macau. Following the success of the spectacular limited edition Grappa pen in hammered copper, Montegrappa again honors the locals’ favorite beverage with a pen inspired by both the drink and the equipment that distills it.  Featuring a shape that is classic Montegrappa, curvaceous yet sleekly contemporary, the Montegrappa Mule pen collection further displays its familial links with a cap top bearing the famous ""1912"" logo, while the nib is embellished with a filigree Montegrappa pattern. The cap and barrel are crafted in mirror-polished copper, further defined by a brushed silver-plated trim. The effect recalls the well-used, vintage piping and tubing employed in the process of producing grappa. Over the time, each Montegrappa Mule will acquire its own unique patina through handling by its fond owner, truly personalizing the writing instrument. Easily recyclable without any loss of property, copper is a naturally hygienic metal that slows down the growth of germs. It is widely used in food preparation and health equipment, as well as in design and various artistic forms. Merely honoring the grappa tradition would be enough to explain the design of the Montegrappa Mule, but Montegrappa’s creativity has been imbued with the spirit of the … spirit! Initially inspired by the classic Moscow Mule cocktail, traditionally served in a copper mug, Montegrappa has registered an exciting new grappa-based cocktail. Created by famous Bassano-based mixologists, brothers Edoardo and Leone Miotti, the recipe is specially developed and already featured on the cocktail menu of Bar Danieli. The Montegrappa Mule will be sipped with relish during the promotion of the pen at various sipping’n’sampling bar and in-store events. The drink itself is made of 40° premium-quality grappa, bergamot scents and a habanero-chilli pepper twist.
﻿Note:﻿ This pen no longer comes with the copper mug pictured.

The Pilot Metal Falcon is a metal version of the very popular Falcon series. Slightly larger and heavier than the resin Falcon, this burgundy red fountain pen pen has a soft rhodium-plated 14k gold nib that will give you line variation as you change your writing pressure. The slightly longer body has enough room to accommodate the included Pilot Con-70 converter, giving you greater ink capacity for longer writing sessions. You can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges or any other Pilot converter.
The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. The finish of the Metal Falcon is a gloss lacquer, with a sparkly metallic color that catches the light in a subtle, yet very impressive way. The pen is trimmed with polished rhodium accents.
This is a slightly heavier pen than most at 33g, a noticeable difference from the lighter resin version of the Falcon. It's well-balanced though, even posted. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Metal Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's build quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.

                                    The Noodler's Ahab flex pen features a steel flexible #6 nib and a slide piston mechanism. If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This pearlescent red Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

An innovative line with a strong attitude. The Aurora Ipsilon, with its unmistakably shaped clip, is a loyal everyday companion dedicated to those who work and study. The barrel and cap are made of a bordeaux red resin with gold-plated accents and a matching gold-plated steel nib. This fountain pen comes with an Aurora blue ink cartridge and an Aurora converter in a black gift box. A light and well-balanced snap-cap pen, the Ipsilon is a great every day carry pen. With a toothier nib, this pen is ideal for those who like to feel their pen on the paper. Brian's thoughts: The Ipsilon writes differently than most other fountain pens you may have used. They're intentionally toothy, meaning that they have a pretty noticeable amount of feedback (resistance) as you write. This is especially the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, which are actually quite narrow in line width and a little dry. There's a pretty noticeable jump in size between the fine and medium, so if you like wetter/smoother nibs, going with a medium or broad will be the way to go. The italic nib is actually more of a true italic, meaning that the edges are crisper than you typically see coming from any other pen company I've seen (typically, to get italics this crisp you have to get it custom ground). The italic can take some getting used to, so don't despair if you need to practice a bit, it's very sensitive to rotation in your hand. Get the hang of it though and you have a wet and crisp italic like I've seen from no other company!

An innovative line with a strong attitude. The Aurora Ipsilon, with its unmistakably shaped clip, is a loyal everyday companion dedicated to those who work and study. The barrel and cap are made of a green resin with gold-plated accents and a matching gold-plated steel nib. This fountain pen comes with an Aurora blue ink cartridge and an Aurora converter in a black gift box. A light and well-balanced snap-cap pen, the Ipsilon is a great every day carry pen. With a toothier nib, this pen is ideal for those who like to feel their pen on the paper. Brian's thoughts: The Ipsilon writes differently than most other fountain pens you may have used. They're intentionally toothy, meaning that they have a pretty noticeable amount of feedback (resistance) as you write. This is especially the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, which are actually quite narrow in line width and a little dry. There's a pretty noticeable jump in size between the fine and medium, so if you like wetter/smoother nibs, going with a medium or broad will be the way to go. The italic nib is actually more of a true italic, meaning that the edges are crisper than you typically see coming from any other pen company I've seen (typically, to get italics this crisp you have to get it custom ground). The italic can take some getting used to, so don't despair if you need to practice a bit, it's very sensitive to rotation in your hand. Get the hang of it though and you have a wet and crisp italic like I've seen from no other company!

This orange Noodler's Nib Creaper flex fountain pen features a small, slender body with a steel flexible #2 nib and a twist piston mechanism. A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.  The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.  As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!  Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The body of this Platinum #3776 Century Nice Lavande fountain pen features an exquisite rose gold trim and a frosted lavender purple translucent body, representative of the French resort (Nice) located in the South of France. Lavande means lavender in French. It comes with a Platinum ink cartridge and a converter for use with bottled ink, and it features a 14k rose gold nib.
Like the other Platinum #3776 Century fountain pens, the Nice Lavande has the ""Slip and Seal"" cap mechanism that prevents the ink from drying out as well as the newly redesigned nib and feed to regulate the ink flow.
Nice is a world-renowned resort and tourist city located in Cote d’Azur in southern France. In early summer, Province region experiences its most beautiful season, with blooming fields of lavender that stretch all the way to the horizon. ""Lavande"" is the French word for lavender, which was the inspiration for this new color of pen.
The light purple lavender flowers, gently blowing in the early summer wind and bathed in soft light, are expressed through a sandblast finish applied on the high transparency resin barrel. Thereafter, sharp accent lines are added through shaper cutting. The pen also features an exquisite pink gold metal trim.
Lavande, the French word for lavender, is said to be the ""queen of herbs,"" which is highly fragrant and has been prized as a medicinal herb since ancient Roman times for its healing effect. In flower language, lavender denotes ""silence"" due to the tranquilizing effect as well as its magically strong scent. As the flower language implies, this Lavande fountain pen creates a sense of calm, inviting one to breathe deeply into writing, making it unique among other Nice models.
The first 3000 pens will come with an individually numbered blotter card,  then ongoing it will be a regular offering.

An innovative line with a strong attitude. The Aurora Ipsilon, with its unmistakably shaped clip, is a loyal everyday companion dedicated to those who work and study. The barrel and cap are made of a matte blue resin with silver accents and a matching steel nib. This fountain pen comes with an Aurora blue ink cartridge and an Aurora converter in a black gift box. A light and well-balanced snap-cap pen, the Ipsilon is a great every day carry pen. With a toothier nib, this pen is ideal for those who like to feel their pen on the paper. Brian's thoughts: The Ipsilon writes differently than most other fountain pens you may have used. They're intentionally toothy, meaning that they have a pretty noticeable amount of feedback (resistance) as you write. This is especially the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, which are actually quite narrow in line width and a little dry. There's a pretty noticeable jump in size between the fine and medium, so if you like wetter/smoother nibs, going with a medium or broad will be the way to go. The italic nib is actually more of a true italic, meaning that the edges are crisper than you typically see coming from any other pen company I've seen (typically, to get italics this crisp you have to get it custom ground). The italic can take some getting used to, so don't despair if you need to practice a bit, it's very sensitive to rotation in your hand.

The body of this Platinum #3776 Century Oshino fountain pen, which is transparent like clear waters, matches perfectly with any ink color. It comes with a Platinum ink cartridge and a converter for use with bottled ink, and it features a rhodium-plated 14k gold nib. Launched in 2011 as the first edition of the Fuji Five Lake series, ""Motosu"", with its completely transparent body, has drawn a great attention. Seven years since its launch, Platinum is now introducing ""Oshino"", which has a clear body of a higher level of transparency. Created by pursuing a transparency like clear waters, this new fountain pen has been named after Oshino Hakkai, which is a famous destination for the beautiful springs sourced from the underground water of Mount Fuji. Platinum is proud to add this product to their #3776 Century series that bears the height of Mount Fuji in its name. A special part with a motif of Mount Fuji is placed at the crown of the pen. In addition, a method of etching is applied to the cap ring to provide a three-dimensional effect, which makes the pen even more precious. In commemoration of the launch of Oshino fountain pen, it comes with a blotter card with a serial number for the initial 3,000 production lots.

                                    The Homo Sapiens is handmade from hardened basaltic lava sourced from the Mount Etna volcano in Italy, with an all-black trim. Visconti lava is virtually unbreakable, comfortable and warm to the touch - and slightly hygroscopic, absorbing moisture from your hand. The pen caps using the Visconti 'Hook Safe Lock', a revolutionary capping system so you can cap a pen without worrying about the cap accidentally unscrewing in your pocket and leaking. The fountain pen's vacuum power filler is made of titanium to resist ink corrosion, and it features an oversized black 23k Palladium Dreamtouch nib. You can also customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.

Crafted from high-grade, hand-made European resins, the Conklin All American is impressively large in size, yet not so big as to be uncomfortable in the hand. The screw cap and barrel are carefully tapered to provide a nice balance. The trademark Rocker Clip allows users to easily secure the pen to a shirt or coat pocket. The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a #6 steel nib in black.The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design.

We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience! Please note that the nib will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

An innovative line with a strong attitude. The Aurora Ipsilon, with its unmistakably shaped clip, is a loyal everyday companion dedicated to those who work and study. The barrel and cap are made of a matte black resin with silver accents and a steel nib. This fountain pen comes with an Aurora blue ink cartridge and an Aurora converter in a black gift box. A light and well-balanced snap-cap pen, the Ipsilon is a great every day carry pen. With a toothier nib, this pen is ideal for those who like to feel their pen on the paper. Brian's thoughts: The Ipsilon writes differently than most other fountain pens you may have used. They're intentionally toothy, meaning that they have a pretty noticeable amount of feedback (resistance) as you write. This is especially the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, which are actually quite narrow in line width and a little dry. There's a pretty noticeable jump in size between the fine and medium, so if you like wetter/smoother nibs, going with a medium or broad will be the way to go. The italic nib is actually more of a true italic, meaning that the edges are crisper than you typically see coming from any other pen company I've seen (typically, to get italics this crisp you have to get it custom ground). The italic can take some getting used to, so don't despair if you need to practice a bit, it's very sensitive to rotation in your hand. Get the hang of it though and you have a wet and crisp italic like I've seen from no other company!

A Goulet exclusive! This blue Brenta di Notte fountain pen is a limited production run of 300 pens, and is our third exclusive launch of this model to the world, following the successful Rosso Ciliegia red and Verde Altipiano green.A world leader in the creation of fine writing instruments, since the Renaissance, Italy championed the fountain pen through the craftsmanship of Elmo. This was the name initially used from 1927 by Montegrappa, the world leader in the creation of the perfect tools for creating missives, jotting notes, producing a signature with a flourish. After an absence of almost 75 years, Elmo returns as a pen conceived to reawaken a love for penmanship, with charms to lure a generation more accustomed to texting. Our third exclusive Elmo model comes in a dark blue resin.  The name of this pen, Brenta di Notte, is inspired by the blue waters of the Brenta river at night. The Brenta is an river that runs from the north in Trentino to the Veneto region. Thus Brenta di Notte – translated as Brenta at night – connects the color to the iconic river and its place in Bassano del Grappa, the home of Montegrappa. 
Every Elmo pen boasts the design values of the era that gave us the most elegant fashions and the most beautiful motorcars, a decade that to this day continues to influence architecture and fashion: the 1930s and the Art Deco movement that defined it. The Elmo pen therefore exhibits a classic form, ergonomically ideal for the smoothest writing sensation, but so chic that it deserves to be regarded as an objet d’art as much as it is a fine instrument.In common with its Montegrappa siblings, the Elmo pen is made of the finest materials, is offered as a cartridge/converter fountain pen with a #6 JoWo steel nib. It includes a converter and two black Montegrappa short standard international ink cartridges. Each pen’s pocket clip terminates in a rolling ball to facilitate ingress and egress from one’s pocket. As a final touch, the pen’s cap is subtly engraved with the contemporary logo of Montegrappa, in a complementary tone.

The Opus 88 Koloro fountain pen is truly unique writing instrument. Featuring a sharp alternating material scheme of beige ebonite and teal blue resin, this pen’s design stands on its own.
The Koloro is a traditional Japanese style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the ebonite blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Koloro’s impressive ink capacity. Having the translucent resin portions of the pen allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.
The Koloro features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.

The LAMY Dialog 3 is a revolutionary fountain pen without a cap. Thanks to a fascinating twist mechanism the nib slides elegantly out of the interior of the barrel, while the clip retracts onto the shell. The twist-action fountain pen is then ready to write. When the fountain pen is twisted closed, a ball valve automatically moves in front of the opening and protects the retracted nib from drying out and getting dirty. The clip lifts up and the fountain pen can be clipped into a pocket or bag.
This matte black fountain pen comes with a smooth interchangeable two-tone 14K gold nib. It comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge and a Z27 converter to get you started writing right away!
Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.

Crafted from high-grade, hand-made European resins, the Conklin All American is impressively large in size, yet not so big as to be uncomfortable in the hand. The screw cap and barrel are carefully tapered to provide a nice balance. The trademark Rocker Clip allows users to easily secure the pen to a shirt or coat pocket. The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a #6 steel nib.The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design. We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

<p><i>From Montegrappa:</i><br><br> Inspiration comes to us at Montegrappa from a variety of sources and places and events and objects. All celebrate some aspect of life, and what enriches it. In the wake of the great success of the Mule line, inspired by a famous cocktail, we looked again at another favourite tipple, the Blue Blazer. <br><br> An enticing mix of scotch, boiling water and powdered sugar, the Blue Blazer earns its incendiary name from the theatre that accompanies it: the drink is set alight. Celebrating its 155th birthday this year, the Blue Blazer is said to be the first cocktail to undergo the touch of the flame. Most distinctively, the drink is prepared with two large tankards, between which the stream of flame travels. <br><br> Our Montegrappa Blazer is based on the Fortuna shape, but with its cap and body made, appropriately, of fire-burnished stainless steel with a vintage-looking brushed silver trim. The polished steel surface of the pen barrel and cap basks in bluish, iridescent shades, just as a heated metal would do.</p>

A Goulet exclusive, special edition design! This resin fountain pen features a purple base that transitions to a glow-in-the-dark blue at the end of the barrel and cap, with large multi-colored sparkles throughout. It has a silver colored stainless steel nib, a translucent purple resin grip and accents, is clipless, and does post. This fountain pen comes with a standard international converter and one long blue ink cartridge. You can also convert it to eyedropper fill.Never before visible to the naked eye, Titan, the first known moon of Saturn, has inspired this first collaboration between Benu and the Goulet Pen Company. In Greek mythology the Titans were divine beings thought to personify the Earth and the Sky or Heavens.  In this special edition pen, we created a gentle band of luminescent glow-in-the-dark blue that fades into a darker pool of deep purple. Across this background a cascade of glittering stars provides a unique impression of the heavens in each pen. Graphic and flamboyant, the pens from the Hexagon collection features the pattern of nature’s most perfect six-sided polygon shapes. Aesthetically pleasing, balanced, and harmonious, with its seamless symmetry and balance, Hexagons are the true inspirations for those who prefer edgy geometry design.

The triangular rubberized ergonomic grip helps you properly hold the pen, ideal especially for beginners. The body of the pen features an ink window so that you can see when your ink is getting low.

The Platinum Plaisir fountain pen features a cap which prevents ink from drying, enabling smooth writing even after no use for a whole year. The outside body is made of aluminum and has a special matte finish.The Plaisir series is characterized by its coloring properties with depth of the aluminum body. Platinum Pen selected black, which is their corporate color, for the new color of the year as the Company marks its 100th anniversary in 2019. A smooth and pleasant texture has been achieved by applying a blast processing while the surface reflection has been softened to produce an impression as if the pen is covered by mist, from which the name ""Black Mist"" comes.  By putting an extra effort in the surface finishing, ""Black Mist"" adds a new look to the Plaisir series. It matches perfectly with digital tools such as smartphones, personal computers and digital cameras, enabling a wide range of use both at work and leisure.
This fountain pen has a matte black barrel and cap, silver trim, a stainless steel nib, and accepts proprietary Platinum cartridges (one is included) or a Platinum converter (sold separately).

The highest level of craftsmanship has been generously poured into this Platinum fountain pen in magnificently decorating it with Kanazawa leafs. This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink. Petals of cherry blossoms, which have been in full bloom, now fall and swirl in the wind. Gold leafs and pink Kanazawa leafs are used to portray the scene. The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.

The Noodler’s Boston Safety Pen is made of ebonite, a traditional material used for vintage safety pens. Safety pens are designed to help prevent any ink from leaking while capped. Unlike traditional fountain pens that seal around the grip when closed, the safety pen helps to create a seal right at the ink reservoir. They are not as vulnerable to pressure changes when traveling. They also start right up after periods of non-use due to the fact that the nib and feed stay submerged in ink when retracted.
When you first open it, you will notice that the nib is completely retracted into the barrel. To expose the nib, simply push and twist on the back of the pen, keeping the pen in a vertical position with the nib facing up. This is important! Otherwise the entirety of the ink supply will pour out of the pen. Slowly twist and push all the way up.
To fill this pen, retract the nib fully back into the barrel of the pen, and fill using an eyedropper or an ink syringe with no more than 1ml (to avoid overfilling and spillage).
To close the pen, you will need to retract the nib back into the barrel, keeping it vertical with the nib facing up, before screwing the cap back on.
We strongly recommend that you watch Nathan’s video below on best practices for using and filling this pen, as it is unlike anything else we carry.
It uses a #2 flexible nib, the same as the Noodler’s Nib Creaper flex pen.
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!

Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.
UltraResin:
Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.
Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.GlueLess Technology:
To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.Cap Lock:
The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.
Clip:
A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.
Band:
Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free. 
Nib:
Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.

Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineider’s interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firm’s illustrious name.

The Pilot Justus 95 features an innovative adjustable 14k gold nib that allows the user to make the writing point softer (""S"", or soft/semi-flex) or more stiff (""H"", or hard) simply by turning the tension adjuster at the top of the gripping section. The soft setting will allow for greater line-width variation, versus the hard which will write like a traditional stiff nib. The Justus 95 fountain pen is available in a black ribbed resin pattern with gold accents. The pen comes with an included Pilot CON-70 converter which holds an ample ink supply while uniquely combining the characteristics of a vacuum-filling and push-button converter. It also accepts Pilot/Namiki ink cartridges (one is included). Each Justus 95 pen is packaged in an elegant gift box.

The Pineider La Grande Bellezza, or The Great Beauty, is a new collection of fountain pens made in Italy designed by Dante Del Vecchio. Part of the new Gemstones collection, this Rodolite Red fountain pen features a red hand-blended resin and marble body, a quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's “soft touch magnetic lock” cap system. This fountain pen fills via standard international cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes. This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible. Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write. We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

The Conklin Nozac is a revitalized design of a vintage Conklin collection. This fountain pen features an eight-sided polished acrylic resin, accented with silver chrome. It opens/closes via a magnetic snap-cap, and fills via internal piston mechanism. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.
Conklin, the legendary name for fine writing instruments, returns with a revitalized design of a timeless classic, the Nozac piston filler. Originally released in 1931, Conklin took the world by storm with their patented piston-filler and polygonal design. The Conklin Nozac (""no sack"") was the only American piston-filler in production at the time. Exceptional to look at and even better in hand, the Nozac is as unique as it is stunning. Based on the original model, the new Nozac fountain pen is machined to perfection and painstakingly hand-polished. The body features eight smooth faceted sides, and is then adorned with striking silver along the clip, grip, and ends. Made from European grade acrylic resin, each fountain pen displays a wide variety of color. The Ohio Blue is a dazzling shade of true blue, marbled with shades of white, silver, and greens. New to Conklin, each cap is magnetized along the barrel and innermost lining, for a secure closure, whether at the office or traveling. Similar to winding watches, to fill the fountain pen you simply move the filling mechanism forward by twisting the knob (non-ending screw) located at the back of the pen. Draw ink into the barrel by twisting the knob in the opposite direction, creating the vacuum that draws the ink through the nib.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience! The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size. This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Conklin Nozac is a revitalized design of a vintage Conklin collection. This fountain pen features an eight-sided polished acrylic resin, accented with silver chrome. It opens/closes via a magnetic snap-cap, and fills via internal piston mechanism. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.
Conklin, the legendary name for fine writing instruments, returns with a revitalized design of a timeless classic, the Nozac piston filler. Originally released in 1931, Conklin took the world by storm with their patented piston-filler and polygonal design. The Conklin Nozac (""no sack"") was the only American piston-filler in production at the time. Exceptional to look at and even better in hand, the Nozac is as unique as it is stunning. Based on the original model, the new Nozac fountain pen is machined to perfection and painstakingly hand-polished. The body features eight smooth faceted sides, and is then adorned with striking silver along the clip, grip, and ends. Made from European grade acrylic resin, each fountain pen displays a wide variety of color. The Toledo Red is a stunning shade of dark maroon marbled with a mix of colors, flecked with purple, gold, blue, or orange. New to Conklin, each cap is magnetized along the barrel and innermost lining, for a secure closure, whether at the office or traveling. Similar to winding watches, to fill the fountain pen you simply move the filling mechanism forward by twisting the knob (non-ending screw) located at the back of the pen. Draw ink into the barrel by twisting the knob in the opposite direction, creating the vacuum that draws the ink through the nib.
We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience! The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size. This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The interesting color nuances from light-transparent to intense orange characterize this series and make the writing instruments nearly gleam.

The fluorescent luminous paints used in the pen are completely free from radioactivity and any potential hazards. The resin body features a light lavender purple and black base with tons of silver and blue sparkles throughout. It has a silver colored Schmidt stainless steel nib, a black resin grip and accents, is clipless, and does not post. This fountain pen comes with a standard international converter and one long blue ink cartridge.

                                    This turquoise and blue acrylic resin Noodler's Neponset fountain pen is fitted with a flexible three-tined music nib, which has a velvet pen stroke with the ability to greatly vary the line width to the users liking. It has a built-in slide piston mechanism for use with bottled ink.The Neponset is a glimpse back in time to an era of legacies and war heroes. The New England Airship company, later renamed the Dartmouth Airship Co., the first of its kind in the United States, had a new CEO during a challenging time for our country. During the year of 1929 Nathan’s grandfather became CEO and one year later christened a new airship named the Neponset.The shape of the Neponset pen is similar to the dirigible and is constructed of acrylic resin.The Neponset is fitted with a three tined music nib, the ""Vishnu Victory"" nib in honor of the 2.5 million World War II allied soldiers of India as well as the reference to the source for the ebonite used in the pen and the original Neponset Blimp.We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here. But hey, that just makes each pen unique!

To highlight the visual appeal of the material, the BENU Briolette has its entire body covered with long facets. Each cut gives the pens specific shapes that prevent them from rolling and enables the true color and brilliance of the material to emerge. The Luminous Blue pen glows beautifully in a dark and semi-dark after an hour exposure to light. A sustained blue glow lasts for up to 12 hours, fading over time. The fluorescent luminous paints used in the pen are completely free from radioactivity and any potential hazards. The resin body features a light blue and black base with tons of silver and blue sparkles throughout.

The highest level of craftsmanship has been generously poured into this Platinum fountain pen in magnificently decorating it with Kanazawa leafs. This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink. A tree leaf turning red in autumn is floating in a little stream. The changing color of the autumn leaf are delicately and beautifully portrayed with the use of ""scattered leaf technique"" applied to gold and colored leafs. The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.

The Pineider La Grande Bellezza, or The Great Beauty, is a new collection of fountain pens made in Italy designed by Dante Del V ecchio. Part of the new Gemstones collection, this Malachite Green fountain pen features a green hand-blended resin and marble body, a quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's “soft touch magnetic lock” cap system. This fountain pen fills via standard international cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes. This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible. Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write. We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

The wreath made from its leaves and branches was given particularly to crown exemplary authors such as major poets who served the king. Likewise, gold is also the color of the medal given to honor individuals for their highest achievement. Therefore, this fountain pen that combines laurel green and gold colors is the most suitable piece that symbolizes honor, glory and victory while increasing your status and power by continuously creating a culture. The Laurel Green fountain pen conveys Platinum's hope to support you in opening a way to new future and winning glory.

The Opus 88 Koloro fountain pen is truly unique writing instrument. Featuring a sharp alternating material scheme of blue ebonite and resin, this pen’s design stands on its own.
The Koloro is a traditional Japanese style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the ebonite blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Koloro’s impressive ink capacity. Having the translucent resin portions of the pen allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.
The Koloro features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.

The Pineider La Grande Bellezza, or The Great Beauty, is a new collection of fountain pens made in Italy designed by Dante Del Vecchio. Part of the new Gemstones collection, this Lapis Blue fountain pen features a blue hand-blended resin and marble body, a quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's “soft touch magnetic lock” cap system. This fountain pen fills via standard international cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes.This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible. Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write. We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

The highest level of craftsmanship has been generously poured into this Platinum fountain pen in magnificently decorating it with Kanazawa leafs. This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink. A variety of different techniques of applying a gold leaf are used in depicting ""the moon and autumn grasses"" while delicate silver lines realistically portray the rabbit on silver leaf. The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.

To celebrate their 30th anniversary, Visconti is pleased to launch this newest, most affordable regular edition fountain pen collection: the Mirage. Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Horn resin has silver and grey swirls. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a “mirage” or an optical illusion. It features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.”This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.
You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

Please note you may receive a push-in style converter instead of the Visconti Deluxe Converter pictured.

Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.
UltraResin:
Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.
Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.GlueLess Technology:
To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.Cap Lock:
The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.
Clip:
A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.
Band:
Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free. 
Nib:
Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.

Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineider’s interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firm’s illustrious name.

A century of Bauhaus and the work of a technology pioneer are the foundations of an Italian pen that will appeal to the fans of the EDC (Every Day Carry), objects that we carry with us every day. Montegrappa is best known for the production of pens that go far beyond the fantasies - and budgets - of the average writing enthusiast, but the latest collection from the Bassano company sees a return to its more modest roots and the vision of its original co-founder, Heinrich 'Elmo' Helm. The factory that today produces the most sophisticated pens in the world was among the first, from 1912 to 1928, to commit itself to democratize writing. In those days, portable pens were an emerging technology full of problems and still looking for broad acceptance as knowledge and networking tools. Helm was the first technical director of the company, a figure with a hard work and an optimism that reminds today's technology entrepreneurs. His know-how and his charisma inspired the young company to give its name to their first products, and Elmo pens would become the cornerstones of Italian offices and schools in the coming years. The Montegrappa Elmo is a compact, round pen that recalls the international style popularized by the Bauhaus in the 1920s. During that time, Helm led his company away from the archetypes of diving pens and designed new solutions to meet contemporary lifestyles. Portability, reliability and efficiency were his mantra. In 2019, writing instruments are again sought after as essential objects for everyday use (EDC) and the Elmo model is among the first pens produced in Europe to meet this need. Crafted in resin with stainless steel hardware, it offers robust, all-round performance, honest simplicity and a century of know-how in prestigious stationery. The Montegrappa Elmo fountain pen comes with a #6 JoWo steel nib and includes a converter and cartridge. Each pen’s pocket clip terminates in a rolling ball to facilitate ingress and egress from one’s pocket. As a final touch, the pen’s cap is subtly engraved with the contemporary logo of Montegrappa.

The Opus 88 Picnic fountain pen is fun and full of personality! It is a traditional Japanese-style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut off value. The purple tinted demonstrator body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped. The Picnic features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib.
An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Picnic's impressive ink capacity.

Legend has it that the president of Esterbrook loved exotic cars. That is why in 1964 the Phaeton 300 was born, offering a sleek fountain pen with a hooded nib. Originally offered as a gift set for Christmas, these pens became a highly sought-after prize in the pen collecting world. The Esterbrook Phaeton rides out into the market once more; reborn as the Phaeton 300R. The New Phaeton 300R fountain pen is made using 1960’s inspired acrylic colors specially produced for Esterbrook. This green resin pen features a gold-plated hooded nib in medium, and uses a removable plunger style filling system. You can also remove the piston mechanism and fill it via eyedropper if you prefer. A brushed chrome metal cap with gold plated clip adds style to this iconic Esterbrook revival.

The Pineider La Grande Bellezza, or The Great Beauty, is a new collection of fountain pens made in Italy, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The clear resin body and cap on this limited edition Honeycomb pen feature hexagonal cutouts, and a small inner cap helps keep the nib from drying out. It features a rhodium-plated quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's ""soft touch magnetic lock"" cap system. This fountain pen fills via cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging also includes a free black leather single pen case (a $75 value), in which you'll find the pen upon initial unboxing. Only 888 of these limited edition pens are available worldwide. Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.

The smooth and shiny metallic white aluminum body offers an excellent weight balance when posted, and the screw cap features Platinum’s “Slip & Seal Mechanism” that helps prevent the ink from drying out in the pen. The newly designed feeder helps you fill your pen when only a small amount of ink is left in the bottle, without having to submerge the entire nib. It comes with a smooth writing steel nib and a Platinum ink cartridge (converter sold separately).

To celebrate their 30th anniversary, Visconti is pleased to launch this newest, most affordable regular edition fountain pen collection: the Mirage. Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Emerald resin has a green base with swirls of yellow and dark green. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a “mirage” or an optical illusion. It features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.”This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.
You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

Please note you may receive a push-in style converter instead of the Visconti Deluxe Converter pictured.

The Opus 88 Koloro fountain pen is truly unique writing instrument. Featuring a sharp alternating material scheme of red ebonite and resin, this pen’s design stands on its own.
The Koloro is a traditional Japanese style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the ebonite blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Koloro’s impressive ink capacity. Having the translucent resin portions of the pen allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.
The Koloro features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.

The highest level of craftsmanship has been generously poured into this Platinum fountain pen in magnificently decorating it with Kanazawa leafs. This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink. Movements of ripples are exquisitely depicted by changing colors of ripples from gold to silver. The goldfish in vermillion reinforces the dynamic impression. The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.

                                    This Namiki maki-e fountain pen was created by a collaboration of maki-e artists (Kokkokai) in Japan. The Nippon Art collection features the Hira Maki-e technique (flat maki-e), depicting a Chinese phoenix. The pen has a 14k gold nib in size #10, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a velvet-lined wooden box. The Nippon Art Collection takes traditional Japanese and auspicious subjects known the world over, and has them drawn on a black lacquered background in Hira Maki-e (Flat Maki-e). The shiny black of the lacquer, along with the overflowing vibrancy from each work makes it a sight to behold. With the Hira Maki-e technique, the lacquered main design is decorated with sprinkled gold and silver powders. Several additional layers of lacquer are then applied. After the lacquer is hardened, it is then burnished. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

The Opus 88 Picnic fountain pen is fun and full of personality! It is a traditional Japanese-style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut off value. The green tinted demonstrator body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped. The Picnic features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib.
An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Picnic's impressive ink capacity.

The highest level of craftsmanship has been generously poured into this Platinum fountain pen in magnificently decorating it with Kanazawa leafs. This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink. An auspicious Mt. Fuji tinged with red at sunrise is expressed with a Kanazawa gold leaf of red color. Golden clouds shining in the sun are depicted with a combination of gold and silver leafs. The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.

Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.
UltraResin:
Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.
Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.GlueLess Technology:
To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.Cap Lock:
The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.
Clip:
A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.
Band:
Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free. 
Nib:
Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.

Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineider’s interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firm’s illustrious name.

The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neon purple fountain pen features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.
Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.
The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:

Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.
Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.
Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.
New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.
New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.

Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.
This blue resin fountain pen has gold trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German gold-plated steel nib. Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.

Turned from solid rods of ebonite and clear resin, the Stipula Etruria Ebonite comes with a matte palladium clip and mid-ring, decorated in Stipula's classic leaf pattern. The oversize Etruria fountain pen has a green and black ebonite cap, grip, and piston knob. The barrel is made of clear resin to allow you to see your ink. The pen is fitted with Stipula's titanium T-flex nib which allows you to write in thick or thin as you adjust your writing pressure. It fills via an internal piston mechanism that allows for maximum ink capacity and flow.  The Stipula Etruria fountain pen has a large, commanding profile and a wonderfully comfortable grip. It is surprisingly lightweight for its size. Etruria, the vintage collection most associated with the Stipula name, is a reference to its land of origin, the region of Tuscany or 'Etruria' as it was known in ancient times.

The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neon green fountain pen features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.
Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.
The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:

Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.
Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.
Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.
New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.
New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.

Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

Establishing the Conklin Pen Company as a leader in American writing instruments, the Crescent Filler became one of Conklin brand’s signature pens and changed the industry forever. Founder Roy Conklin from Toledo, Ohio, patented the design for the first self-filling pen in 1897, causing his company to thrive. They gained the approval of author Mark Twain, who became the official spokesperson for the Conklin brand.
Handmade in idyllic Florence, Italy, the fountain pens utilize Conklin’s groundbreaking original design that still works as effortlessly as it did a century ago. Each pen is engraved with Mark Twain’s signature along the band, and maintains the original Conklin spring loaded rocker clip that was patented in 1916, which is the perfect addition to any pocket, jacket, or coat. We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.
This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Pineider La Grande Bellezza, or The Great Beauty, is a new collection of fountain pens made in Italy designed by Dante Del Vecchio. Part of the Gemstones collection, this Tiger Eye Yellow fountain pen features a yellow hand-blended resin and marble body, a quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's “soft touch magnetic lock” cap system.
This fountain pen fills via standard international cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes. This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible. Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write. We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

The Opus 88 Picnic fountain pen is fun and full of personality! It is a traditional Japanese-style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut off value. The brown tinted demonstrator body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped. The Picnic features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib.
An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed.

Form, fashion, and function are the key to a great writing experience. The designers at Monteverde took this principle, put it to practice, and are happy to present the Essenza collection, a contemporary recreation of an old Monteverde classic. Hand-crafted from European grade acrylic resins and featuring an alluring multi-faceted body and cap, each writing instrument is unique. Displaying a variety of striking marble-like shades, a chrome clip, band, and grip are added to enhance the elegance of each writing instrument, with the Monteverde logo beautifully printed along the band. Each fountain pen cap is threaded, for a secure closure whether in your pocket or briefcase. It has a #6 stainless steel nib to complement the silver trim, and fills via standard international ink cartridges or converter (included).

We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience! The Bock nibs do not have an imprint to note the nib size.
We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Pineider Arco is a new collection of limited edition fountain pens made in Florence, Italy, and designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The beautiful brown resin is reminiscent of a classic fountain pen look from the 20th century. Features Pineider’s flexible nib, a quill-shaped clip, and a “soft touch magnetic lock” cap system. This fountain pen fills via a piston filler, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The Pineider Arco is limited to 888 pieces worldwide, and it comes packaged in a gift box along with a Pineider Pen Filler!Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

                                    The new limited edition Visconti Medici Il Magnifico features a red-brown marble barrel and a sterling silver cap. The pen embodies the essence of the Renaissance period, combining exclusive and precious elements. It fills via Visconti's power filler, closes via the hook-safe-lock system, and features the oversized 23kt palladium nib. Only 188 pieces are available worldwide. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449-1492 Firenze) the Prince of Princes, was an Italian statesman and the ""de facto ruler"" of the Florentine Republic, who was the most powerful and enthusiastic patron of the Renaissance. Also known as Lorenzo il Magnifico (the Magnificent) by his contemporary Florentines, he was a magnate, diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists and poets. He is well known for his contribution to the art world by sponsoring artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. His life coincided with the mature phase of Italian Renaissance. As natural evolution of the Medici collection, Visconti is proud to dedicate a special limited edition to the great statesman of the 15th Century. The pen embodies the essence of the Renaissance period, combining exclusive and precious elements. Another magnificent masterpiece from Visconti symbolic of the power of the Medici family over the rest of the known world. The cap is in solid 925 Sterling Silver finely chiseled with the old techniques handed down from Benvenuto Cellini, the most prestigious jeweler of the 15th Century. The motifs chiseled on the cap and repeated on the blind cap are lilies, symbols of Florence. The top of the cap is enriched with the ancient coat of arms of the Medici family with six balls. The body is the central heart of the pen in solid Levanto reddish marble. It is faceted in eight sides like the baptistery in front of the Dome of Florence that was completed during Lorenzo being ruler of Florence. The choice of the marble was in line with the official colors of the Medici family that can be found in Palazzo Medici Ricciardi official residence of Lorenzo il Magnifico. It comes together with the power filler and the iconic 23kt palladium nib.

Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.
UltraResin:
Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.
Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.GlueLess Technology:
To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.Cap Lock:
The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.
Clip:
A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.
Band:
Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free. 
Nib:
Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.

Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineider’s interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firm’s illustrious name.

Form, fashion, and function are the key to a great writing experience. The designers at Monteverde took this principle, put it to practice, and are happy to present the Essenza collection, a contemporary recreation of an old Monteverde classic. Hand-crafted from European grade acrylic resins and featuring an alluring multi-faceted body and cap, each writing instrument is unique. Displaying a variety of striking marble-like shades, a chrome clip, band, and grip are added to enhance the elegance of each writing instrument, with the Monteverde logo beautifully printed along the band. Each fountain pen cap is threaded, for a secure closure whether in your pocket or briefcase. It has a #6 stainless steel nib to complement the silver trim, and fills via standard international ink cartridges or converter (included).

We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience! The Bock nibs do not have an imprint to note the nib size.
We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.
This blue resin fountain pen has chrome trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.

The Opus 88 Koloro fountain pen is truly unique writing instrument. Featuring a sharp alternating material scheme of orange ebonite and resin, this pen’s design stands on its own.
The Koloro is a traditional Japanese style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the ebonite blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Koloro’s impressive ink capacity. Having the translucent resin portions of the pen allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.
The Koloro features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.

This Graf von Faber-Castell Classic fountain pen comes in pernambuco wood, with platinized fittings and a finely ribbed barrel. The natural differences in grain and color mean that every writing instrument made from them is unique. Pernambuco wood is normally used for violin bows and is extremely hard and durable, and correspondingly difficult to work with. This fountain pen has a hand-made bicolored 18kt gold nib with iridium tip, and fills via standard international cartridge/converter. The manufacturing process involves over a hundred steps, most of them carried out by hand. Handmade in Germany. The feeling conveyed by a noble fountain pen with a gold nib remains incomparable. The slender shape and good balance of the Graf von Faber-Castell Classic pens mean that they sit comfortably in the hand. Well engineered mechanisms and robust details, such as the spring-loaded clip made of solid metal, ensure that the joy of using them is as timeless as the design.

With Platinum's latest technology and innovative cap design, the ""Slip & Seal"" mechanism in this #3776 Century model prevents the ink from drying out for up to 24 months. This opaque white resin fountain pen is accented by gold trim. It accepts proprietary Platinum cartridges or a Platinum converter for use with bottled ink (both are included), and features a 14k gold nib.
Inspired by the Chateau de Chenonceau in Loire in France, also known as the ""castle of six ladies,"" which was owned and loved by six noblewomen through the centuries, the new color Chenonceau White expresses the image of the white, elegant look of the castle. Its soft ivory color matches well with the gold finish, highlighting its grace. Being constructed over the river, the chateau and the waters create an exceptional scenery, which suites the image of the #3776 series that retains moisture of the ink over time thanks to the Slip & Seal Mechanism.

The Pineider La Grande Bellezza, or The Great Beauty, is a new collection of fountain pens made in Italy designed by Dante Del Vecchio. Part of the Gemstones collection, this Stone Black fountain pen features a deep solid black hand-blended resin and marble body, a quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's “soft touch magnetic lock” cap system.
This fountain pen fills via standard international cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes. This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible. Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write. We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

To celebrate their 30th anniversary, Visconti is pleased to launch this newest, most affordable regular edition fountain pen collection: the Mirage. Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Night Blue resin is a dark blue with swirls of light blue. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a “mirage” or an optical illusion. It features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.”This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.
You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

Please note you may receive a push-in style converter instead of the Visconti Deluxe Converter pictured.

                                    This Namiki Yukari Pine Needles maki-e fountain pen was released in November 2013 by a collaboration of maki-e artists (Kokkokai) in Japan. It features the Togidashi-Hira Maki-e technique (burnished-flat maki-e), depicting pine needles and branches. The pen has an 18k gold nib in size #10, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. The Yukari Collection vividly expresses the nature of the four seasons, which the Japanese have been familiar with since ancient times, by combining designs with various techniques such as Togidashi-Taka Maki-e (Burnished-Raised Maki-e) and Raden (Mother-of-Pearl). While being a size that can be carried and used every day, it harbors Japanese beauty down to the finest detail. In Japan, the pine tree, or matsu, shares the same meaning as the Chinese and Korean pine trees. That is longevity, virtue and youth. They are also associated with masculinity and power. The word ""matsu"" means ""waiting for the soul of a god to descend from Heaven"" in Japanese. In the ancient Shinto beliefs, gods were said to have ascended to Heaven on a pine tree, where they now reside on a beautiful volcanic mountain in giant or old trees. Pine trees are associated with the New Year in Japan. So much so that many Japanese hang a bundle of pine twigs and bamboo trunks known as a Kado matsu (Gate pine) on their doors to receive a blessing from the gods. Pines are also used to mark the boundaries of the sacred ground of temples and shrines. Prior to the Edo period (1600-1867), pine trees and branches were a popular choice of decoration for samurai on their armor and katana due to all the associations with masculinity As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip.
This green resin fountain pen has gold-plated trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.

The Opus 88 Picnic fountain pen is fun and full of personality! It is a traditional Japanese-style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut off value. The blue tinted demonstrator body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped. The Picnic features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib.
An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Picnic's impressive ink capacity.

The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neon pink fountain pen features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.
Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.
The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:

Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.
Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.
Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.
New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.
New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.

Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

This Pilot Custom Urushi lacquered ebonite fountain pen was created by maki-e artisans (kokkokai) in Japan. It features the Roiro Urushi technique in solid black. The pen has a two-tone 18k gold nib in the large #30 size. A Pilot Con-70 converter is included, but you can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges if you prefer. It comes packaged in a gift box.  Lacquering has been used in Japan for thousands of years. The Pilot Custom Urushi is crafted from Japanese ebonite and lacquered using only pure Urushi lacquer. Like their Namiki pens, Pilot uses a lacquering technique called Roiro, which requires substantial time and skill to create a uniform and mirror-like finish. Each Custom Urushi pen is lacquered, cured, and polished three times to create a beautiful quality result.

Legend has it that the president of Esterbrook loved exotic cars. That is why in 1964 the Phaeton 300 was born, offering a sleek fountain pen with a hooded nib. Originally offered as a gift set for Christmas, these pens became a highly sought-after prize in the pen collecting world. The Esterbrook Phaeton rides out into the market once more; reborn as the Phaeton 300R. The New Phaeton 300R fountain pen is made using 1960’s inspired acrylic colors specially produced for Esterbrook. This blue resin pen features a gold-plated hooded nib in medium, and uses a removable plunger style filling system. You can also remove the piston mechanism and fill it via eyedropper if you prefer. A brushed chrome metal cap with gold plated clip adds style to this iconic Esterbrook revival.

Legend has it that the president of Esterbrook loved exotic cars. That is why in 1964 the Phaeton 300 was born, offering a sleek fountain pen with a hooded nib. Originally offered as a gift set for Christmas, these pens became a highly sought-after prize in the pen collecting world. The Esterbrook Phaeton rides out into the market once more; reborn as the Phaeton 300R. The New Phaeton 300R fountain pen is made using 1960’s inspired acrylic colors specially produced for Esterbrook. This red resin pen features a gold-plated hooded nib in medium, and uses a removable plunger style filling system. You can also remove the piston mechanism and fill it via eyedropper if you prefer. A brushed chrome metal cap with gold plated clip adds style to this iconic Esterbrook revival.

The Opus 88 Demonstrator fountain pen is truly unique writing instrument. This large non-postable pen is a eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. Featuring a translucent amber-orange resin, this pen’s design stands on its own. It has a silver clip and a silver stainless steel #6 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity. Having a translucent pen body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.

The Midnight in Florence was inspired by Visconti's hometown, the ancient city of Florence, Italy. When darkness falls across Florence, the city reveals aspects of its beauty not shown in daylight. Street corners and buildings change identity as they are shaded by a multitude of darker tones of gray, blue and purple.
The Visconti team has worked hard to replicate these beautiful colors in a new unique resin palette throughout the pens body and cap. The barrel of the pen features ribbons and swirls of shaved acryloid, suspended in a clear acrylic resin while the cap and plunger feature the same colors fixed into in a marbleized navy blue resin. All trims are crafted in 925 sterling silver.
The pen caps using the Visconti 'Hook Safe Lock', a revolutionary capping system so you can cap a pen without worrying about the cap accidentally unscrewing in your pocket and leaking. The fountain pen features Visconti's patented Double Reservoir Power Filler, a unique filling system that allows a greater ink capacity and safe usage during air flights. The vacuum power filler is made of titanium to resist ink corrosion, and it comes equipped with Visconti's 23kt Dreamtouch palladium nib.
The Midnight in Florence Limited Edition series is individually numbered and limited to 888 pens worldwide.  Note: Each of these pens has a different pattern and consistency of swirls. We do our best to photograph a pen that’s indicative of the average overall aesthetics, but expect some variance when you receive yours. It’ll be one-of-a-kind, just like your unique writing style!

The Opus 88 Demonstrator fountain pen is truly unique writing instrument. This large non-postable pen is a eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. Featuring a translucent grey-blue resin, this pen’s design stands on its own. It has a silver clip and a silver stainless steel #6 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity. Having a translucent pen body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.

The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neon blue fountain pen features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.
Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.
The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:

Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.
Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.
Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.
New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.
New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.

Turned from solid rods of ebonite and clear resin, the Stipula Etruria Ebonite comes with a matte palladium clip and mid-ring, decorated in Stipula's classic leaf pattern. The oversize Etruria fountain pen has a dark yellow/brown and black ebonite cap, grip, and piston knob. The barrel is made of clear resin to allow you to see your ink. The pen is fitted with Stipula's titanium T-flex nib which allows you to write in thick or thin as you adjust your writing pressure. It fills via an internal piston mechanism that allows for maximum ink capacity and flow.  The Stipula Etruria fountain pen has a large, commanding profile and a wonderfully comfortable grip. It is surprisingly lightweight for its size. Etruria, the vintage collection most associated with the Stipula name, is a reference to its land of origin, the region of Tuscany or 'Etruria' as it was known in ancient times.  The Etruria Ebonite collection is limited to 88 pieces in each color, each individually numbered, available exclusively at Goulet Pens.

The Opus 88 OMAR fountain pen is a large eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve.The purple barrel of this pen is translucent, allowing you to see your ink level. The cap is made of an opaque flecked resin with different shades of purple. The pen features an ivory resin finial and piston knob, a silver clip, and a silver stainless steel #6 JoWo nib. It also comes with a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity.

Establishing the Conklin Pen Company as a leader in American writing instruments, the Crescent Filler became one of Conklin brand’s signature pens and changed the industry forever. Founder Roy Conklin from Toledo, Ohio, patented the design for the first self-filling pen in 1897, causing his company to thrive. They gained the approval of author Mark Twain, who became the official spokesperson for the Conklin brand.
Handmade in idyllic Florence, Italy, the fountain pens utilize Conklin’s groundbreaking original design that still works as effortlessly as it did a century ago. Each pen is engraved with Mark Twain’s signature along the band, and maintains the original Conklin spring loaded rocker clip that was patented in 1916, which is the perfect addition to any pocket, jacket, or coat. We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock.

Legend has it that the president of Esterbrook loved exotic cars. That is why in 1964 the Phaeton 300 was born, offering a sleek fountain pen with a hooded nib. Originally offered as a gift set for Christmas, these pens became a highly sought-after prize in the pen collecting world. The Esterbrook Phaeton rides out into the market once more; reborn as the Phaeton 300R.  The New Phaeton 300R fountain pen is made using 1960’s inspired acrylic colors specially produced for Esterbrook. This black resin pen features a gold-plated hooded nib in medium, and uses a removable plunger style filling system. You can also remove the piston mechanism and fill it via eyedropper if you prefer. A brushed chrome metal cap with gold plated clip adds style to this iconic Esterbrook revival.

The pen has a 14k gold nib in size #10, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a velvet-lined wooden box. The Nippon Art Collection takes traditional Japanese and auspicious subjects known the world over, and has them drawn on a black lacquered background in Hira Maki-e (Flat Maki-e). The shiny black of the lacquer, along with the overflowing vibrancy from each work makes it a sight to behold. With the Hira Maki-e technique, the lacquered main design is decorated with sprinkled gold and silver powders. Several additional layers of lacquer are then applied. After the lacquer is hardened, it is then burnished. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.

The LAMY Dialog 3 is a revolutionary fountain pen without a cap. Thanks to a fascinating twist mechanism the nib slides elegantly out of the interior of the barrel, while the clip retracts onto the shell. The twist-action fountain pen is then ready to write. When the fountain pen is twisted closed, a ball valve automatically moves in front of the opening and protects the retracted nib from drying out and getting dirty. The clip lifts up and the fountain pen can be clipped into a pocket or bag. This shiny white fountain pen comes with a smooth interchangeable two-tone 14K gold nib. It comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge and a Z27 converter to get you started writing right away! Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing.

The Kaweco Supra fountain pen is the big brother of the Liliput and a quick-change artist. A connector piece transforms this pen from a cartridge-only pocket pen to a full-sized converter-accepting pen. The fountain pen's weight and length can be adjusted to meet the individual needs of its user. The minimalistic design is reminiscent of Bauhaus and Braun.

This fountain pen is made entirely out of brass. Brass will become tarnished when in use and develop an individual patina over time. The well-known ECO brass (brass manufactured by the Wieland Werke in Ulm) is lead-free. 

It comes with a larger #6 Bock stainless steel nib and an ink cartridge to get you started writing right away! The cap screws on to the back to post securely, and it accepts short standard international cartridges. Standard international converter is available separately. It comes packaged in a tin box.Click to shop all compatible short or long standard international ink cartridges.

To celebrate their 30th anniversary, Visconti is pleased to launch this newest, most affordable regular edition fountain pen collection: the Mirage. Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Coral resin has orange and red swirls. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a “mirage” or an optical illusion. It features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.”This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.
You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

Made with a brand new material called Acrosilk, the Visconti Medici fountain pen is an 8-sided, oversized fountain pen designed to invoke the spirit of the Medici mansions of Florence. Trimmed with rose gold, this regular edition fountain pen utilizes Visconti’s power filler mechanism and is fitted with an oversized 23k Palladium Dreamtouch nib plated in rose gold. The Medici is the perfect combination of innovative materials and proven designs.

You cannot learn the history of Florence without hearing about the much celebrated Medici family. The family was a noble house that stood out for their political, financial, and cultural influence on the city of Florence. Most of all, the Medici family was known for their passionate contributions to the development of Humanism and the Italian Renaissance. Predominantly bankers, the family owned one of the largest and most respected banks in Europe at the time. The Medici family were avid patrons of the arts and served as the patron for many artists, including Brunelleschi, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. It was during the Medici’s patronage that da Vinci illustrated Luca Pacioli’s The Divine Proportion which described the formula for geometric relationships that are pleasing to the eye. Thus, this pen is a tribute to one of the greatest dynasties in Italian history.
The Medici pens feature an eight-sided facet design, modeled after the Florentine baptistery, a religious place and symbol of the city's glorious past. The body of the pens are enhanced by the Lily emblem (fleur de lis) engraved on the center band that pays homage to the city of Florence.
To capture the essence of the materials used in the Medici villas, Visconti sought out a new material, something that would be reminiscent of these princely Italian mansions. They created a new material by combining acrylic resin and silk fibers and called it Acrosilk. The Acrosilk in the Medici is deep brown with flecks of a lighter, golden brown, reminiscent of the wood used to construct its namesake’s luxury villas. The Medici family crest is engraved into the gold-plated trim, completing Visconti’s tribute to the Medicis.
This fountain pen comes in a gift box with a manual and is covered by Visconti’s 2-year warranty.

The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neon orange fountain pen features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.
Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.
The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:

Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.
Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.
Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.
New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.
New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.

Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Opus 88 Demonstrator fountain pen is truly unique writing instrument. This large non-postable pen is a eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. Featuring a translucent red resin, this pen’s design stands on its own. It has a sleek black clip and a silver stainless steel #6 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity. Having a translucent pen body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.

Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.
UltraResin:
Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.
Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.GlueLess Technology:
To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.Cap Lock:
The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.
Clip:
A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.
Band:
Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free. 
Nib:
Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.

Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineider’s interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firm’s illustrious name.

The Opus 88 OMAR fountain pen is a large eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve.The green barrel of this pen is translucent, allowing you to see your ink level. The cap is made of an opaque flecked resin with different shades of green and blue. The pen features an ivory resin finial and piston knob, a silver clip, and a silver stainless steel #6 JoWo nib. It also comes with a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity.

The Pineider La Grande Bellezza, or The Great Beauty, is a new collection of fountain pens made in Italy, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The clear resin body and cap on this limited edition Honeycomb pen feature hexagonal cutouts, and a small inner cap helps keep the nib from drying out. It features a rose gold-plated quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's ""soft touch magnetic lock"" cap system. This fountain pen fills via cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt rose gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging also includes a free black leather single pen case (a $75 value), in which you'll find the pen upon initial unboxing. Only 88 of these limited edition pens are available worldwide. Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.

To celebrate their 30th anniversary, Visconti is pleased to launch this newest, most affordable regular edition fountain pen collection: the Mirage. Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Aqua resin has beautiful turquoise/blue swirls. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a “mirage” or an optical illusion. It features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.”This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.
You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.

We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

Please note you may receive a push-in style converter instead of the Visconti Deluxe Converter pictured.

                                    This Namiki maki-e fountain pen was created by a collaboration of maki-e artists (Kokkokai) in Japan. The Nippon Art collection features the Hira Maki-e technique (flat maki-e), depicting a crane and a turtle. The pen has a 14k gold nib in size #10, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a velvet-lined wooden box. The Nippon Art Collection takes traditional Japanese and auspicious subjects known the world over, and has them drawn on a black lacquered background in Hira Maki-e (Flat Maki-e). The shiny black of the lacquer, along with the overflowing vibrancy from each work makes it a sight to behold. With the Hira Maki-e technique, the lacquered main design is decorated with sprinkled gold and silver powders. Several additional layers of lacquer are then applied. After the lacquer is hardened, it is then burnished. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink.

Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.
UltraResin:
Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.
Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.GlueLess Technology:
To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.Cap Lock:
The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.
Clip:
A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.
Band:
Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free. 
Nib:
Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.

Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineider’s interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firm’s illustrious name.
This pen comes with a standard international converter, and also accepts standard international cartridges.

The Opus 88 OMAR fountain pen is a large eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. The brown barrel of this pen is translucent, allowing you to see your ink level. The cap is made of an opaque flecked resin with different shades of brown. The pen features an ivory resin finial and piston knob, a silver clip, and a silver stainless steel #6 JoWo nib. It also comes with a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity.

The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.
This tortoise brown resin fountain pen has chrome trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.

The new limited edition Visconti Torpedo pays homage to the design of fast cars, with its sleek shape and unique materials. The body is made from unidirectional carbon fiber, and the barrel has a palladium-plated overlay. An oversized ink window allows you to see your ink in the barrel, filled via Visconti's double reservoir power filler. This fountain pen is completed with an oversized 23k Palladium Dreamtouch nib, and is limited to 388 pieces worldwide. The pen is inspired by a recent design trend, Bolidismo, born in Italy in the mid-80s by a group of architects and designers who largely attended the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Florence. The founding values of the group were the dynamism of the shapes, somehow a far recall to the Futurism of the early twentieth century, and the reference to design (which strongly influenced the world of cars) and to the Comics strip of the '30s. The Torpedo's name alludes both to the model of car in use from the beginning of the last century up to the 30s (again featuring sleek and sporting shape), and to the English term for torpedo and obvious example of a shape designed by the need for speed). Torpedo therefore, ranks fully in the tradition of the Italian design, here even more specifically Florentine, and it claims its value acknowledged worldwide. The Torpedo, designed in an ogival shape, dynamic and aerodynamic, interrupted only by the clip, integrates in an original way the two traditional aesthetic codes of Visconti's high-end pens: the skeleton processing, and the transparency of the demo models. Above the carbon fiber of the barrel, there is a light metal cover that surrounds two transparent openings which allows the user to see the internal filing system and the ink. The transparent acrylic resin has been worked in such a way as to be aligned with the carbon fiber and not to be at a lower level, thus contributing to the fluidity of the design.

The Pineider Mystery Filler is a new collection of limited edition fountain pens made in Florence, Italy, and designed by Dante Del Vecchio. Features Pineider’s flexible nib, a quill-shaped clip, and a “soft touch magnetic lock” cap system. It has a solid black cap and a clear barrel so you can see the mystery filler in action. The filling mechanism is unique - push the button to extract the piston knob, turn the piston knob like any other piston filler to fill the pen with ink, then push the button again to lock it in place. This fountain pen has a smooth, soft 14kt rose gold nib, which is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. Each pen also comes a Pineider Pen Filler for ease of filling. The Pineider Mystery Filler is limited to 888 pieces worldwide.Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

                                    This Namiki Yukari Rock Garden maki-e fountain pen was released in November 2013 by a collaboration of maki-e artists (Kokkokai) in Japan. It features the Togidashi-Hira Maki-e technique (burnished-flat maki-e), depicting a traditional Japanese rock garden. The pen has an 18k gold nib in size #10, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. The Yukari Collection vividly expresses the nature of the four seasons, which the Japanese have been familiar with since ancient times, by combining designs with various techniques such as Togidashi-Taka Maki-e (Burnished-Raised Maki-e) and Raden (Mother-of-Pearl). While being a size that can be carried and used every day, it harbors Japanese beauty down to the finest detail. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neon yellow fountain pen features Visconti’s new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.
Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.
The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:

Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.
Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.
Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.
New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.
New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.

Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.

The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.
This oversized black resin fountain pen has gold trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German gold-plated steel nib. Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.

With its epic storylines of treachery and nobility, family and honor, ambition and love, and death and survival the hit HBO® series Game of Thrones has captured the imagination of fans globally and made it one of the most popular shows on television. Montegrappa is proud to announce a series of writing instruments that convey the grandeur of this most remarkable saga.

Fiery red stands out against the coal-black on the Montegrappa Game of Thrones Targaryen fountain pen. House Targaryen ruled Westeros for three centuries before the rebellion that put Robert Baratheon on the Iron Throne. The house sigil is a three-headed dragon, although the fountain pen only displays one. The dragon represented is appropriately a European-style dragon. You can find it both on the clip and on the finial, where the house’s motto, ""Fire and Blood,"" can be found. 
The bronze-colored stainless steel nib is decorated with a sword, and the fountain pen accepts standard international cartridges or a converter (included).
Special Gift! To celebrate the 8th and final season, Montegrappa is also including a free coffee mug with purchase that depicts the Targaryen emblem. This pen is on closeout and will not be restocked once sold out.

The Game of Thrones House Stark fountain pen is sleek and cool, with its white and silver coloring. The house motto, “Winter is Coming” is engraved on the top of the cap, along with a depiction of a direwolf, the house sigil. The clip echoes the house sigil as well and is the head of a powerful direwolf. All of the accents are plated in palladium. Because the members of the House Stark are the Kings of the North, Norse runes were used as inspiration for the patterns on the cap of the pen.
The silver stainless steel nib is decorated with a sword, and the fountain pen accepts standard international cartridges or a converter (included).
Special Gift! To celebrate the 8th and final season, Montegrappa is also including a free coffee mug with purchase that depicts the Stark emblem. This pen is on closeout and will not be restocked once sold out.

The Opus 88 OMAR fountain pen is a large eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve.The grey barrel of this pen is translucent, allowing you to see your ink level. The cap is made of an opaque flecked resin with different shades of grey. The pen features an ivory resin finial and piston knob, a silver clip, and a silver stainless steel #6 JoWo nib. It also comes with a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity.

The oversize Etruria fountain pen has a purple and black ebonite cap, grip, and piston knob. The barrel is made of clear resin to allow you to see your ink.

It is surprisingly lightweight for its size. Etruria, the vintage collection most associated with the Stipula name, is a reference to its land of origin, the region of Tuscany or 'Etruria' as it was known in ancient times.  The Etruria Ebonite collection is limited to 88 pieces in each color, each individually numbered, available exclusively at Goulet Pens.

The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.
This black resin fountain pen has chrome trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.

This Pilot Custom Urushi lacquered ebonite fountain pen was created by maki-e artisans (kokkokai) in Japan. It features the Roiro Urushi technique in solid vermillion red. The pen has a two-tone 18k gold nib in the large #30 size. A Pilot Con-70 converter is included, but you can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges if you prefer. It comes packaged in a gift box.  Lacquering has been used in Japan for thousands of years. The Pilot Custom Urushi is crafted from Japanese ebonite and lacquered using only pure Urushi lacquer. Like their Namiki pens, Pilot uses a lacquering technique called Roiro, which requires substantial time and skill to create a uniform and mirror-like finish. Each Custom Urushi pen is lacquered, cured, and polished three times to create a beautiful quality result.

                                    This Namiki Chinkin pen was created by a collaboration of maki-e artists (Kokkokai) in Japan. The pen matches the Yukari size but with a flat top, has an 18k gold nib (#10 size), fills via Pilot/Namiki cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a velvet-lined wooden box. The Chinkin Collection is made up of fountain pens which use ""Chinkin (Gold Inlay)"", one of lacquer ware techniques that Japan boasts to the world on a par with Maki-e. Motifs are carved into the lacquered surface with special chisels, and after inlaying lacquer in the grooves, placing gold leaves and gold powder gives the pattern expression. The delicate and fine depiction and three-dimensional aspect overflowing with a strong power of expression are the special characteristics of this collection. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

The LAMY Dialog 3 is a revolutionary fountain pen without a cap. Thanks to a fascinating twist mechanism the nib slides elegantly out of the interior of the barrel, while the clip retracts onto the shell. The twist-action fountain pen is then ready to write. When the fountain pen is twisted closed, a ball valve automatically moves in front of the opening and protects the retracted nib from drying out and getting dirty. The clip lifts up and the fountain pen can be clipped into a pocket or bag. This shiny black fountain pen comes with a smooth interchangeable two-tone 14K gold nib. It comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge and a Z27 converter to get you started writing right away! Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing.

Empire, meaning absolute sway, was the inspiration behind this daring new design. Torpedo shaped with tapered ends, each Empire is made from quality acrylic resins and is engineered to perfection, creating its distinctive and unforgettable fluted cap and body design. A timeless new model, the Empire not only gives each writing instrument a unique shape but an ergonomic and sculpted feel, perfect for daily writing. Paired with engraved silver accents, the clip displays the legendary Conklin trademarked name which is painstakingly hand painted in blue lacquer, while the cap band is painted red.

Crafted from high-grade, hand-made European resins, the Conklin All American is impressively large in size, yet not so big as to be uncomfortable in the hand. The screw cap and barrel are carefully tapered to provide a nice balance. The trademark Rocker Clip allows users to easily secure the pen to a shirt or coat pocket. The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a #6 steel nib.The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design. We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and we’re confident that you’ll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.

The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.
This oversized black resin fountain pen has chrome trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately).

                                    This Namiki Chinkin pen was created by a collaboration of maki-e artists (Kokkokai) in Japan. The pen matches the Yukari size but with a flat top, has an 18k gold nib (#10 size), fills via Pilot/Namiki cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a velvet-lined wooden box. The Chinkin Collection is made up of fountain pens which use ""Chinkin (Gold Inlay)"", one of lacquer ware techniques that Japan boasts to the world on a par with Maki-e. Motifs are carved into the lacquered surface with special chisels, and after inlaying lacquer in the grooves, placing gold leaves and gold powder gives the pattern expression. The delicate and fine depiction and three-dimensional aspect overflowing with a strong power of expression are the special characteristics of this collection. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

The new Visconti Pentagon fountain pen features a dark blue five-sided faceted resin body, palladium trim, magnetic cap closure, standard international cartridge/converter fill, and a steel nib.
From Visconti:
A bet, or better a challenge: this is in brief the birth of the new Visconti Pentagon pen. A reference to the clean but imposing and solid surfaces of Empire-style furniture, without inlays but enriched by the presence of clear metallic decorations, combined to the formal values from which one of the most iconic lines of Visconti production is born, the Divina collection.

The Golden Number: the proportion between the length of the cap and the body tends to the divine proportion, maintaining that percentage of imprecision which is proper of human nature.
The Pentagram: the pentagonal section, which characterizes the pen itself, converges into the pure shape of circumference at both ends.
The Nautilus or ""Spirale d'oro"": according to the Fibonacci formula, spiral is here developed and spread in a harmonious movement which fades to the circles of tops of the cap and the blind cap.

These elements merge, like for Divina, in an alchemy of shapes and proportions, in a pen that can be defined elegant but static, powerful: its antiquity, like the one of the Roman and Greek temples, is timeless, so deeply hidden today in our culture that it can be confused with humanity itself. The pentagon, which the pen is built on, contributes to define it as a solid, delimited object, capable of a static equilibrium: this let the pen balance on a plane without rolling also without the cap (uniquely within the current collection).At the same time, the clip determines an orientation, a directionality in its static symmetry, favoring one of the five sides over others and thus introducing a hidden dynamism: if rotated on its longitudinal axis, the Pentagon changes continuously, looking unusually asymmetric.

This Namiki Chinkin pen was created by a collaboration of maki-e artists (Kokkokai) in Japan. The pen matches the Yukari Royale size, has an 18k gold nib (#10 size), fills via Pilot/Namiki cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a velvet-lined wooden box. The Chinkin Collection is made up of fountain pens which use ""Chinkin (Gold Inlay)"", one of lacquer ware techniques that Japan boasts to the world on a par with Maki-e. Motifs are carved into the lacquered surface with special chisels, and after inlaying lacquer in the grooves, placing gold leaves and gold powder gives the pattern expression. The delicate and fine depiction and three-dimensional aspect overflowing with a strong power of expression are the special characteristics of this collection. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word.

As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

With its epic storylines of treachery and nobility, family and honor, ambition and love, and death and survival the hit HBO® series Game of Thrones has captured the imagination of fans globally and made it one of the most popular shows on television. Montegrappa is proud to announce a series of writing instruments that convey the grandeur of this most remarkable saga.

The Game of Thrones Westeros fountain pen unites the sigils of rival houses under the might of one sword. Westeros is named after the continent that is to King’s Landing, Dorne, the Iron Islands and other pivotal locations from the series.
Born in the wake of the huge success of Montegrappa’s first regular editions of Game of Thrones writing instruments, the Westeros pen represents four of the primary noble houses, celebrating the series with a combination of lordly black resin and that most martial of materials: stainless steel.
Enriching the body of every pen are laser-cut contrast sigils of the main houses of the saga: Targaryen, Tyrell, Stark, Lannister. Aficionados can choose the house they favor most – or acquire the original quartet. In keeping with the most important images of the series, the signature clip is forged into a sword, while the cap is further embellished with blood-red enamel accents. As a finishing touch, the cap top has been personalized with the Game of Thrones logo.
The Westeros fountain pen comes with a beautifully engraved #6 Jowo stainless steel nib, and the fountain pen accepts standard international cartridges or a converter (included).
Special Gift! To celebrate the 8th and final season, Montegrappa is also including a free coffee mug with purchase that depicts the map of Westeros. This pen is on closeout and will not be restocked once sold out.

The Pineider Mystery Filler is a new collection of limited edition fountain pens made in Florence, Italy, and designed by Dante Del Vecchio. Features Pineider’s flexible nib, a quill-shaped clip, and a “soft touch magnetic lock” cap system. It has a solid black cap and a clear barrel so you can see the mystery filler in action. The filling mechanism is unique - push the button to extract the piston knob, turn the piston knob like any other piston filler to fill the pen with ink, then push the button again to lock it in place. This fountain pen has a smooth, soft rhodium-plated 14kt gold nib, which is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. Each pen also comes a Pineider Pen Filler for ease of filling. The Pineider Mystery Filler is limited to 888 pieces worldwide.Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.

The Chinkin Collection is made up of fountain pens which use ""Chinkin (Gold Inlay)"", one of lacquer ware techniques that Japan boasts to the world on a par with Maki-e. Motifs are carved into the lacquered surface with special chisels, and after inlaying lacquer in the grooves, placing gold leaves and gold powder gives the pattern expression. The delicate and fine depiction and three-dimensional aspect overflowing with a strong power of expression are the special characteristics of this collection. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word.

The Platinum Karakusa Blue Celluloid fountain pen features a hand-engraved silver-filled pattern on a blue celluloid #3776 body with rhodium-plated trim. Throughout the predominantly blue celluloid is a varied blend of black and white marbling.Celluloid is rare in modern fountain pens, due to the difficulty of making this material. It is flammable, half transparent plastic material which is made by mixing nitric-cellulose (sulfuric acid and nitric acid are added to cellulose), camphor and alcohol. Celluloid softens at 90 degrees Celsius and hardens when cooled. After the celluloid is made and allowed to cure over many months, the entire body and cap of this pen is then hand engraved with a floral motif, using the Japanese Chinkin technique. The engraving is then filled in with a metallic silver powder.It accepts proprietary Platinum cartridges or a Platinum converter for use with bottled ink (both are included), and features a rhodium-plated 14k gold nib.

It’s copper, compact and impossibly cute – perfectly suited for any pocket, pencil case, purse or tool roll. Inspired by the Fortuna Copper Mule, this Mini Mule fountain pen has been engineered to use smaller #5 steel nibs, taking a standard convertor or cartridges just like conventional Fortuna models.  The new Mini Mule shares the same anti-microbial properties as its older sibling, as well as the patina and imperfections unique to copper. Like a Traveler’s Company notebook, its changing appearance records the places it has been. Owners will thrill as they observe it aging gracefully with use. A true workhorse!  The Mule program, and the creation of the Montegrappa Mule by Bassano’s own Danieli Bar have provided one of the most warmly received Montegrappa stories of recent years, attracting interest from lifestyle and cuisine editors. The Mini Mule arrives in a standard case that includes the recipe for the famous cocktail.  As well as bringing a fresh, rootsy finish to the Fortuna silhouette, Mule’s honest rustic charm and gastronomic credentials have resonated with younger, hipster-inclined shoppers. With the arrival of the Mini Mule, we can turn up the charm and offer more to intrepid urban travelers, women and fans of every day carry (EDC).  The Copper Mule features a copper barrel with brushed stainless steel accents, creating an elegant yet modern look. The pen features a super smooth steel nib, and accepts cartridges or a converter (included). The copper will patina on the pen over time (unless polished - cloth included), creating a unique look to you. Since 1912, for more than a century, Montegrappa has been manufacturing high-quality writing instruments in the same historic building in Bassano del Grappa, North East Italy. Within a stone’s throw of the Montegrappa works – home of the oldest pen manufacture in Italy – is the heart of another industry. Grappa is the local tipple, and it has never been more popular, finding new friends in bars and saloons from Mumbai to Manhattan to Macau. Following the success of the spectacular limited edition Grappa pen in hammered copper, Montegrappa again honors the locals’ favorite beverage with a pen inspired by both the drink and the equipment that distills it.  Featuring a shape that is classic Montegrappa, curvaceous yet sleekly contemporary, the Montegrappa Mule pen collection further displays its familial links with a cap top bearing the famous ""1912"" logo, while the nib is embellished with a filigree Montegrappa pattern. The cap and barrel are crafted in mirror-polished copper, further defined by a brushed silver-plated trim. The effect recalls the well-used, vintage piping and tubing employed in the process of producing grappa. Over the time, each Montegrappa Mule will acquire its own unique patina through handling by its fond owner, truly personalizing the writing instrument. Easily recyclable without any loss of property, copper is a naturally hygienic metal that slows down the growth of germs. It is widely used in food preparation and health equipment, as well as in design and various artistic forms. Merely honoring the grappa tradition would be enough to explain the design of the Montegrappa Mule, but Montegrappa’s creativity has been imbued with the spirit of the … spirit! Initially inspired by the classic Moscow Mule cocktail, traditionally served in a copper mug, Montegrappa has registered an exciting new grappa-based cocktail. Created by famous Bassano-based mixologists, brothers Edoardo and Leone Miotti, the recipe is specially developed and already featured on the cocktail menu of Bar Danieli. The Montegrappa Mule will be sipped with relish during the promotion of the pen at various sipping’n’sampling bar and in-store events.

There are products that have written the history of Aurora, unique pieces that mark uneraseable memories. This legacy passed down through years of passion and unchanged care of detail should be reinterpreted in a different key and shared again for all lovers of writing instruments and Aurora collectors.
This Aurora Internazionale fountain pen has a cap and barrel made in marbled blue Auroloide. It is complemented by gold-plated trim, and an 18kt solid gold nib. Limited Edition of only 919 numbered pieces.
It comes packaged in an elegant box in black wood with black interior, with a bottle of black ink and a special vintage sleeve.
The Internazionale features Aurora’s unique piston filler design with a built-in ink reserve. When the pen runs dry, extend the piston to access enough ink for several more pages of writing. The piston knob will remain extended acting as a reminder to refill the pen while still allowing the cap to be posted.
This pen was inspired by one of Aurora's earlier vintage models from the 1930's. It has many details that show Italian handwork, including the trim rings that are hand-worked and polished, a jewel clip with vintage decorations, the clip tied to a ring with floral decorations, and an ebonite feed.

                                    This Namiki Chinkin pen was created by a collaboration of maki-e artists (Kokkokai) in Japan. The pen matches the Yukari Royale size, has an 18k gold nib (#10 size), fills via Pilot/Namiki cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a velvet-lined wooden box. The Chinkin Collection is made up of fountain pens which use ""Chinkin (Gold Inlay)"", one of lacquer ware techniques that Japan boasts to the world on a par with Maki-e. Motifs are carved into the lacquered surface with special chisels, and after inlaying lacquer in the grooves, placing gold leaves and gold powder gives the pattern expression. The delicate and fine depiction and three-dimensional aspect overflowing with a strong power of expression are the special characteristics of this collection. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

The LAMY Dialog 3 is a revolutionary fountain pen without a cap. Thanks to a fascinating twist mechanism the nib slides elegantly out of the interior of the barrel, while the clip retracts onto the shell. The twist-action fountain pen is then ready to write. When the fountain pen is twisted closed, a ball valve automatically moves in front of the opening and protects the retracted nib from drying out and getting dirty. The clip lifts up and the fountain pen can be clipped into a pocket or bag. This fountain pen comes with a smooth interchangeable two-tone 14K gold nib. It comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge and a Z27 converter to get you started writing right away! Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.

The new Visconti Pentagon fountain pen features a black five-sided faceted resin body, palladium trim, magnetic cap closure, standard international cartridge/converter fill, and a steel nib.
From Visconti:
A bet, or better a challenge: this is in brief the birth of the new Visconti Pentagon pen. A reference to the clean but imposing and solid surfaces of Empire-style furniture, without inlays but enriched by the presence of clear metallic decorations, combined to the formal values from which one of the most iconic lines of Visconti production is born, the Divina collection.

The Golden Number: the proportion between the length of the cap and the body tends to the divine proportion, maintaining that percentage of imprecision which is proper of human nature.
The Pentagram: the pentagonal section, which characterizes the pen itself, converges into the pure shape of circumference at both ends.
The Nautilus or ""Spirale d'oro"": according to the Fibonacci formula, spiral is here developed and spread in a harmonious movement which fades to the circles of tops of the cap and the blind cap.

These elements merge, like for Divina, in an alchemy of shapes and proportions, in a pen that can be defined elegant but static, powerful: its antiquity, like the one of the Roman and Greek temples, is timeless, so deeply hidden today in our culture that it can be confused with humanity itself. The pentagon, which the pen is built on, contributes to define it as a solid, delimited object, capable of a static equilibrium: this let the pen balance on a plane without rolling also without the cap (uniquely within the current collection).At the same time, the clip determines an orientation, a directionality in its static symmetry, favoring one of the five sides over others and thus introducing a hidden dynamism: if rotated on its longitudinal axis, the Pentagon changes continuously, looking unusually asymmetric.

                                    This Namiki Yukari Nightline maki-e fountain pen was created by maki-e artists Shinsai and Yumi in Japan. It features the Raden and the Togidashi Maki-e technique (burnished maki-e). The raden shells are delicately handlaid to create a nighttime skyline scene. The pen has an 18k gold nib in size #10, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. The Yukari Collection vividly expresses the nature of the four seasons, which the Japanese have been familiar with since ancient times, by combining designs with various techniques such as Togidashi-Taka Maki-e (Burnished-Raised Maki-e) and Raden (Mother-of-Pearl). While being a size that can be carried and used every day, it harbors Japanese beauty down to the finest detail. For the raden technique: The inside surface stratum of various shells such as turban, trumpet and ear shaped shells etc. are pealed off in a thin layer. They are then cut into small pieces and these are coated with Urushi lacquer to secure them in place. This is then burnished to create a finish. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

                                    This Namiki Emperor fountain pen was just released in late 2016 and has been decorated with maki-e by the skilled artisan Mamoru in Japan. It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), and depicts two dragons, one on the cap and one on the barrel. Raden abalone shells accent the background. This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create. Enthralled by the intriguing beauty of the mythical creatures, Namiki beautifully captures the magnificence and quintessence of the Dragon. Fearsome and powerful, dragons are also considered benevolent and the bringers of wealth and good fortune. In Japanese mythology, the dragon is highly-regarded as the Guardian of the East and symbolizes strength, power and protection. It is also known a symbol of fertility, wealth and success. There are two types of Japanese dragons; one belonging to the sky while the other is found in bodies of water, and as such is reflected in the cap and body of this pen. The sky dragon depicted on the cap of the fountain pen is seen fiercely guarding the pearl within its three-clawed grasp, believed to be the wish-fulfilling pearl jewel. The magic ball is also known as Cintamani, a sacred stone that gives power and makes its possessor's wishes come true. As the dragon is endowed with supernatural powders, it is also usually linked to water. Thus the dragon in the air uses the Cintamani power to attract rain in the spring and avoid floods in the fall. The Taka Maki-e technique helps to accentuate the awesome presence of the two auspicious dragons. Waves and clouds are treated with silver Taka Maki-e creating the perfect contrast with these golden dragons. In the background, the Togidashi and Raden Maki-e techniques are on display, with a black lacquer studded with multicolored glittering abalone shell particles. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

With its epic storylines of treachery and nobility, family and honor, ambition and love, and death and survival the hit HBO® series Game of Thrones has captured the imagination of fans globally and made it one of the most popular shows on television. Montegrappa is proud to announce a series of writing instruments that convey the grandeur of this most remarkable saga.

The ferocious lion is the symbol of the House Lannister, and the Montegrappa Game of Thrones Lannister fountain pen represents this fierce family with aplomb! A regal red lacquer body accented in contrasting yellow gold is the dominant color. The cap features a lion’s head clip, while the finial has a lion and the house’s motto, ""Hear Me Roar."" A floral pattern, reminiscent of the Tudor Rose, decorates the cap. In the books, the House Lannister is full of some of the most complex and complicated characters, but the fountain pen displays the richness of house.
The gold-plated stainless steel nib is decorated with a sword, and the fountain pen accepts standard international cartridges or a converter (included).
Special Gift! To celebrate the 8th and final season, Montegrappa is also including a free coffee mug with purchase that depicts the Lannister emblem. This pen is on closeout and will not be restocked once sold out.

                                    Lorenzo de' Medici was an Italian Statesman and a 15th century Ruler of the Florentine Republic. Considered as one of the most powerful and enthusiastic patrons of the Renaissance age, Medici was commonly known as Lorenzo ""il Magnifico"" (the Magnificent) by his contemporary Florentines as he was an influential businessman, diplomat, politician and a patron of scholars, artists and poets.  Visconti's il Magnifico collection embodies the essence of the Renaissance period, combining luxurious and precious materials. The cap and blind cap are made from solid 925 sterling silver and is finely chiseled with the fleur-de-lis motif, a symbol of Florence. The top of the cap is enriched with the ancient coat of arms of the Medici family.  The body of the pen is made from solid Italian Levanto marble and is faceted on eight sides like the Baptistery of Florence, whose famous doors are symbols of the Italian Renaissance. Visconti selected a rich green marble for the Serpentine which was inspired by elements of the Santa Maria Novella church in Florence. The green and white enameling in the clip mimics this same marbled pattern. The il Magnifico Serpentine fountain pen features Visconti's power filling system and their iconic 23kt Palladium nib. The il Magnifico Serpentine collection is limited to 188 pieces worldwide.

The Chinkin Collection is made up of fountain pens which use ""Chinkin (Gold Inlay)"", one of lacquer ware techniques that Japan boasts to the world on a par with Maki-e. Motifs are carved into the lacquered surface with special chisels, and after inlaying lacquer in the grooves, placing gold leaves and gold powder gives the pattern expression. The delicate and fine depiction and three-dimensional aspect overflowing with a strong power of expression are the special characteristics of this collection. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

The impressive LAMY Imporium features an exciting combination of strong design and powerful structure. This characteristic model adds yet another family of high-quality writing instruments to LAMY's premium assortment, uniting modern, functional design with a luxurious writing experience.
The trademark of the LAMY Imporium series is its prominent straight-lined body structure and grip. The cylindrically designed smooth cap with solid, high-gloss clip provides a striking contrast. The combination of playful details and consistent reduction gives this model its unmistakable appearance.
The fountain pens are refined and partially galvanized with an especially high-quality PVD coating. From the nib to the clip – only first-class metals are used: gold, platinum, or titanium. One special highlight of the pen is the PVD-refined bicolor 14kt gold nib which guarantees a uniquely soft writing experience and is available in different nib widths.
The LAMY imporium was designed by Mario Bellini, one of the most distinguished designers of the last 30 years. He was one of the first living designers after Charles Eames to ever receive the honor of having a solo exhibition in the MOMA New York.
This fountain pen comes in a luxury gift box, a LAMY ink cartridge, and a Z27 converter for use with bottled ink so you can get started writing right away.
Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.

                                    This Namiki Emperor maki-e fountain pen was created by maki-e artisan Yutaka in Japan in early 2015. It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), as well as Rankaku (quail shells). This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create. In the Japanese culture, the owl, or ""Fukuro"", means luck and protection from hardship or suffering. Using ebonite as its base, the Rankaku Maki-e is used to design both the owls on the pen, and the Raden technique is used to embed the eyes of the owls making them sparkle. A layer of clear urushi lacquer is then used to protect the surface of the pen giving it a glossy polish. The Rankaku artwork is simply outstanding with the incredible attention to detail. Two owls can be seen on the pen. The owl on the cap is perched on a Quercusserate tree, showcasing the nocturnal bird’s exceptional ability in seeking out its prey in the still of the night. The owl in the barrel is depicted silently flapping its wings and swooping in for the kill. The Rankaku technique is a unique method whereby the motifs are designed using the powder or small pieces of quail shells. They are fixed into the lacquer and later coated with another layer of lacquer. The layer of lacquer is then burnished to reveal the design of the pen. The Raden technique, on the other hand, is a technique whereby the stratum of various abalone shells are peeled into thin layers. Then they are cut into small pieces before being coated with urushi lacquer to hold them in place. The urushi is then burnished to create a finish. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

The impressive LAMY Imporium features an exciting combination of strong design and powerful structure. This characteristic model adds yet another family of high-quality writing instruments to LAMY's premium assortment, uniting modern, functional design with a luxurious writing experience.
The trademark of the LAMY Imporium series is its prominent straight-lined body structure and grip. The cylindrically designed smooth cap with solid, high-gloss clip provides a striking contrast. The combination of playful details and consistent reduction gives this model its unmistakable appearance.
The fountain pens are refined and partially galvanized with an especially high-quality PVD coating. From the nib to the clip – only first-class metals are used: gold, platinum, or titanium. One special highlight of the pen is the PVD-refined bicolor 14kt gold nib which guarantees a uniquely soft writing experience and is available in different nib widths.
The LAMY imporium was designed by Mario Bellini, one of the most distinguished designers of the last 30 years. He was one of the first living designers after Charles Eames to ever receive the honor of having a solo exhibition in the MOMA New York.
This fountain pen comes in a luxury gift box, a LAMY ink cartridge, and a Z27 converter for use with bottled ink so you can get started writing right away.
Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.

Raden is a traditional Japanese decorative craft mainly used for lacquer ware and woodwork. By working with small stripes of precious shell material, the artist of the Raden pen creates a beautiful, impressive piece of art. Each piece is truly unique.
The first step to create the fountain pen Raden M805 Royal Platinum is to give the surface a deep black impression by using the special Japanese Urushi lacquer. Then the typical stripes are made with particles from the precious white mother of pearl shell. A platinum foil is carefully affixed one by one to the backside of the stripes. In the next step, the stripes are fixed to the cap and barrel by a coating of lacquer. Finally, the artist individually signs and numbers each fountain pen with the Maki-e technique, which used to be reserved exclusively for Japanese Royals as an indication of their power.
With the limited edition Raden series, Pelikan applies this wonderful Japanese decorative craft to fountain pen models of its famous Souverän® series. The Raden M805 Royal Platinum fountain pens are pieces of art with finely-chased and completely rhodanized 18kt gold nib in medium only. Each piston-filling fountain pen is encased in a traditional Japanese gift box which is made of Paulownia wood. The Raden M805 Royal Platinum is available in a limited edition of 388 pieces worldwide.

                                    This Namiki Yukari Royale Frog maki-e fountain pen was created in 2017 in Japan by maki-e artisan Yumi Hayashi, who also has the distinction of being the first woman hired as a Maki-e artist by Namiki. It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), depicting frogs, leaves, and water designs. The pen has an 18k gold nib in size #20, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Extraordinary artistry and craftsmanship, along with superior attention to detail, embody the essence of the Japanese Maki-e art form. The exquisite hyper-realistic, animal inspired design of the Yukari Royale Frog is brought to life through the thousands of skillful touches of the master artisan. The artisan started with drawing the intricate lines of the frogs, leaves and water designs on the lustrous black Urushi lacquer surface, and then skillfully sprinkled 18-karat gold foil and powder in a continuous manner creating a dimensional, powerful and expressive masterpiece. Captured stunningly on the body of the fountain pen, the artisan has expressed the passage of time by portraying a variety of flowers that come into bloom at different times throughout the year. The tranquil flow of water is expressed with luminous Raden (Mother-of-pearl) and Kawari-nuir. Also among the carefully curated scene are three golden frogs dynamically depicted moving around in a lively manner. Frogs in Japanese, also referred to as “kaeru,” are known to be a popular motif as a lucky charm that will bring health, longevity, protection and wealth.  Each year, after hibernating, the frog has the peculiarity to go back to the pond of its birth, whatever the distance, for reproduction. Its name in Japanese (kaeru) is pronounced the same way as the word, which means return. This characteristic has made it a protective animal for travelers (often as protective amulets) and the symbol of hospitality. Symbol of fertility, because it lays numerous eggs in one go, the frog is also the one of happy returns of any kind, chance, age, happiness, money, etc. It is also thought to give the power of attracting wealth (it was the emblem of the tax collectors in feudal times). At last, it represents resurrection and metamorphosis, the perpetual transformation of man.Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

                                    This Namiki Emperor maki-e fountain pen was created in 2012 by maki-e artisan Masaru in Japan. It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), depicting a mythical created called a Kylin. This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create. The Kylin is thought to have a compound appearance with a dragon’s head, antlers, horse hoofs, an oxtail, wolf’s forehead and a colorful chest. It is lively, intelligent and most of all gentle but valorous to ward off devils. To see a Kylin is a good omen that brings rui, roughly translated as ""serenity"" or ""prosperity"" and it is the custom in some regions, to believe that the Kylin will give them a son. Although it looks fearsome, the Kylin only punishes the wicked. It can walk on grass yet not trample the blades, and it can also walk on water. As it is a peaceful creature, its diet does not include flesh. It takes great care when it walks never to harm or tread on any living thing, and it is said to appear only in areas ruled by a wise and benevolent leader (some say even if this area is only a house). It is normally gentle but can become fierce if a pure person is threatened by a sinner, spouting flames from its mouth and exercising other fearsome powers that vary from story to story. Legends tell that the Kylin has appeared in the garden of the legendary Huangdi and in the capital of Emperor Yao. Both events bore testimony to the benevolent nature of the rulers. It's been told in legends that the birth of the great sage Confucius was foretold by the arrival of a Kylin. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.

During the year of 1929 Nathan’s grandfather became CEO and one year later christened a new airship named the Neponset.The shape of the Neponset pen is similar to the dirigible and is constructed of the original fountain pen material ebonite, which was vulcanized in 1844 by Charles Goodyear in Massachusetts whose company built the Neponset airship.The Neponset is fitted with a three tined music nib, the ""Vishnu Victory"" nib in honor of the 2.5 million World War II allied soldiers of India as well as the reference to the source for the ebonite used in the pen and the original Neponset Blimp.

Made with a brand new material called Acrosilk, the Visconti Medici fountain pen is an 8-sided, oversized fountain pen designed to invoke the spirit of the Medici mansions of Florence. Trimmed with yellow gold, this regular edition fountain pen utilizes Visconti’s power filler mechanism and is fitted with an oversized 23k Palladium Dreamtouch nib plated in yellow gold. The Medici is the perfect combination of innovative materials and proven designs.You cannot learn the history of Florence without hearing about the much celebrated Medici family. The family was a noble house that stood out for their political, financial, and cultural influence on the city of Florence. Most of all, the Medici family was known for their passionate contributions to the development of Humanism and the Italian Renaissance. Predominantly bankers, the family owned one of the largest and most respected banks in Europe at the time. The Medici family were avid patrons of the arts and served as the patron for many artists, including Brunelleschi, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. It was during the Medici’s patronage that da Vinci illustrated Luca Pacioli’s The Divine Proportion which described the formula for geometric relationships that are pleasing to the eye. Thus, this pen is a tribute to one of the greatest dynasties in Italian history.
The Medici pens feature an eight-sided facet design, modeled after the Florentine baptistery, a religious place and symbol of the city's glorious past. The body of the pens are enhanced by the Lily emblem (fleur de lis) engraved on the center band that pays homage to the city of Florence.

To capture the essence of the materials used in the Medici villas, Visconti sought out a new material, something that would be reminiscent of these princely Italian mansions. They created a new material by combining acrylic resin and silk fibers and called it Acrosilk. The Acrosilk in the Medici is blue with swirls of yellow. The beautiful colors of the Medici Dynasty collection emulate the semi-precious stone mosaics that embellish the Medici villas. The Medici family crest is engraved into the gold-plated trim, completing Visconti’s tribute to the Medicis.

This fountain pen comes in a gift box with a manual and is covered by Visconti’s 2-year warranty. Due to the nature of the material, no two are exactly alike - our photography is representative of what you could expect.

The impressive LAMY Imporium features an exciting combination of strong design and powerful structure. This characteristic model adds yet another family of high-quality writing instruments to LAMY's premium assortment, uniting modern, functional design with a luxurious writing experience.
The trademark of the LAMY Imporium series is its prominent straight-lined body structure and grip. The cylindrically designed smooth cap with solid, high-gloss clip provides a striking contrast. The combination of playful details and consistent reduction gives this model its unmistakable appearance.
The fountain pens are refined and partially galvanized with an especially high-quality PVD coating. From the nib to the clip – only first-class metals are used: gold, platinum, or titanium. One special highlight of the pen is the PVD-refined bicolor 14kt gold nib which guarantees a uniquely soft writing experience and is available in different nib widths.
The LAMY imporium was designed by Mario Bellini, one of the most distinguished designers of the last 30 years. He was one of the first living designers after Charles Eames to ever receive the honor of having a solo exhibition in the MOMA New York.
This fountain pen comes in a luxury gift box, a LAMY ink cartridge, and a Z27 converter for use with bottled ink so you can get started writing right away.
Note: To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.

This black and white marbled limited edition Diplomat Aero fountain pen features a Zeppelin-inspired aluminum body with groove-like depressions on the barrel and cap. The unique pattern is made using a hydro dipping marbling technique - the swirling color dyes are floated on the surface of a solution, then each pen is dipped in, transferring the pattern onto the body of the pen. A protective coating is then placed on the marbled pen. No two are exactly alike!
The Aero has a satisfying soft sliding click cap that posts securely onto the barrel when writing. It features a smooth writing #6 JoWo stainless steel nib or two-tone 14kt gold nib, a dark grey grip and trim, and fills via standard international cartridge/converter (both are included).
Due to the unique manufacturing process, there is at least one point on every pen where a small gap or overlap in the pattern could occur. These vary in severity, location, and subtlety and are to be expected with this Volute design.
Here's an explanation from Diplomat on how this unique finish is applied:
Always looking for surprising and innovative effects for our range, Diplomat is proud to propose the new Volute.Aero Volute is the result of our research for possibilities to apply detailed and colorful decoration on our metal pens.For this, we used Hydro dipping or so called water transfer printing technology. This technique made big evolutions for the last years and is used mainly today for personalization, not in industrial series.As you can see with this link for examples video, painted decoration is applied by water solution.A film with the decoration to be transferred is carefully placed on the water’s surface in a dipping tank. This clear film is water soluble and dissolves after applying an activator solution.Once dipping is begun, the surface tension of the water will allow the pattern to curve around any shape. The ink adheres and will not wash off.In order to have good quality and resistance there are some preparation steps of the surface and finishing steps too, using appropriate clear lacquer. Even more, a real know how for the use of the activator, a perfect dipping technic are required….all this for an amazing result full of colors and details.We chose this Volute pattern to demonstrate the quality of the details, the respect of the shades of black and provide to the Aero a real different personality.In a reference to smoke volutes, this aerial design fits the spirit of Aero.Not used in our writing instrument industry, this kind of decoration and technology enhanced Diplomat modernism through our Flagship Aero and our capacity to surprise our partners and consumers.

The Aurora 88 Nettuno is made entirely in Torino, Italy. The cap and barrel are made from marbled teal blue Auroloide while the cap’s finial, grip section, and piston knob are made from black resin. It features a rhodium-plated 18kt gold nib and chrome-plated trim.
This pen also features Aurora's exclusive Hidden Reservoir piston fill system with a built-in ink reserve. It gives you just a bit of extra ink so you don’t run dry mid-thought. When it is starting to run dry, just twist the piston knob a couple times to release the extra ink. Each Aurora 88 Nettuno comes in an elegant box in black lacquered wood, with black interior to enhance its brightness. A commemorative sleeve celebrates Aurora's first 100 years. It comes with a manual and is covered by Aurora’s 2-year manufacturer’s warranty.  Aurora only produced 888 of these pens and each one is individually numbered.

                                    This Namiki Emperor maki-e fountain pen was created by maki-e artisan Shinsai in Japan. It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), depicting the Japanese author Murasaki Shikibu. This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create. The Emperor Collection is Namiki's highest ranking series. The body is shaped with ebonite, featuring the ""Togidashi-Taka Maki-e (Burnished-Raised Maki-e)"" technique, where high skills are necessary. As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki. Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen. Please also note we are unable to accept a return of this pen for any reason once it has been used with ink. Please thoroughly inspect and dry test the pen before use.
