If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This clear demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-clear-demonstrator.jpg?v=1525274748,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-clear,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-clear-demonstrator.jpg?v=1525274748', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-ClearDemonstrator-1.jpg?v=1525274748', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-ClearDemonstrator-2.jpg?v=1525274748', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-ClearDemonstrator-3.jpg?v=1525274748', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-ClearDemonstrator-4.jpg?v=1525274748', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-ClearDemonstrator-5.jpg?v=1525274748', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-ClearDemonstrator-6.jpg?v=1525274748', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-ClearDemonstrator-7.jpg?v=1525274748']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
<br><br>
The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-nib-creaper-clear.jpg?v=1548887362,noodlers-nib-creaper-flex-fountain-pen-clear,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-nib-creaper-clear.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-ClearDemo-1.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-ClearDemo-3.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-ClearDemo-4.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-ClearDemo-5.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-ClearDemo-6.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-ClearDemo-7.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-CrystalClear-1_9704c09a-7b23-4799-8538-d6b26e927e65.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-CrystalClear-2_92eb113d-78f8-47d5-add9-c6eb657cdc36.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-CrystalClear-3.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-CrystalClear-7.jpg?v=1548887362', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-CrystalClear-9.jpg?v=1548887362']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

This fountain pen features a clear demonstrator body with a stainless steel nib.<br><br> The Vac700 has been updated to now be called the Vac700R. TWSBI made small updates to the internal of the pen valving. The old Vac700 used to have 2 small valves. Now, it has only 1 large valve. The bottom of the grip/feeder section has also been enlarged and tapered more drastically. They found by doing these two adjustments, the flow of the pen when the end cap is open increased a small percentage. This is the same design they incorporated in the Vac Mini series.<br><br> Due to the bottom of the grip/feeder section being enlarged and tapered differently, the individual nib sets from the original Vac700 pen will NOT work on the Vac700R. Only the Vac700R nib sets will go along with the Vac700R fountain pen.<br><br> TWSBI's belief is that it is important to allow the user to disassemble and reassemble the pen and completely experience the traditional aspects of owning and using a fountain pen. These pens also come packaged with a wrench and silicone grease. Neither of these accessories are intended to be used immediately, as they are for long-term care and maintenance. Additionally, please use extra care if you choose to disassemble the nib and feed, as the feed is very fragile.<br><br>If you're taking apart this pen, note that the mechanism on the Vac700R removes out of the pen inÂ a counter-clockwise direction. This is the opposite direction from other TWSBI pens like the 580.",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-3.jpg?v=1525275325,twsbi-vac700r-fountain-pen-clear,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-3.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-1.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-4.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-5.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-6.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-7.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-8.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-9.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-10.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-11.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-12.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-13.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-14.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/TWSBI-Vac700R-Clear-15.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/twsbi-vac700r-comparison.jpg?v=1525275325', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ALL-TW-Vac700-New_f4aaab93-3f64-4673-a95e-a2a5c1d5ee25.jpg?v=1525275325']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

This clear fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!<br><br>
While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-konrad-clear.jpg?v=1548887046,noodlers-konrad-flex-fountain-pen-clear,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-konrad-clear.jpg?v=1548887046', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ClearDemo-1.jpg?v=1548887046', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ClearDemo-3.jpg?v=1548887046', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ClearDemo-4.jpg?v=1548887046', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ClearDemo-5.jpg?v=1548887046', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ClearDemo-6.jpg?v=1548887046', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ClearDemo-7.jpg?v=1548887046', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ClearDemo-8.jpg?v=1548887046']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

It is most famous for its rhodium-plated 14k gold soft nib, which provides line variation when you change your writing pressure. This solid black fountain pen has rhodium trim and includes a Con-40 converter and a Pilot/Namiki ink cartridge, packaged in a Pilot gift box.<br><br> The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. Pilot doesn't advertise this as a ""flex"" pen, though it has that reputation in the fountain pen community. It most certainly provides distinct line variation, though you can overdo it, so just be cognizant of how far you're pushing it when you flex the nib tines. <br><br> The soft extra-fine nib is quite fine, and has a very toothy feel to it though it does provide the most dramatic line variation of all the nib options. The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs. Pilot (and other Japanese nib companies) has a reputation for grinding their nibs finer than European brands. We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs.<br><br> The Falcon is made of black resin, a light material that polishes to a high gloss. The pen is trimmed with polished gold accents, which really complement the black color nicely. The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers. <br><br> This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly.<br><br> While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>

It is most famous for its 14k gold soft nib, which provides line variation when you change your writing pressure. This solid black fountain pen has gold trim and includes a Con-40 converter and a Pilot/Namiki ink cartridge, packaged in a Pilot gift box.<br><br>
The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. Pilot doesn't advertise this as a ""flex"" pen, though it has that reputation in the fountain pen community. It most certainly provides distinct line variation, though you can overdo it, so just be cognizant of how far you're pushing it when you flex the nib tines. <br><br>
The soft extra-fine nib is quite fine, and has a very toothy feel to it though it does provide the most dramatic line variation of all the nib options. The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs. Pilot (and other Japanese nib companies) has a reputation for grinding their nibs finer than European brands. We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs.<br><br>
The Falcon is made of black resin, a light material that polishes to a high gloss. The pen is trimmed with polished gold accents, which really complement the black color nicely. The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers. <br><br>
This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly.<br><br>
While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>

It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a âToledo, Ohioâ engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. ItÂ comes with a silver #6 steel nib.<br><br>In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.<br><br>The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.</p>
<p><em>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!<br><br>The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.<br><br>This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.</em></p>

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This blue and white Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>

<p><span>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</span></p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-lapis-inferno.jpg?v=1525274754,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-lapis-inferno,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-lapis-inferno.jpg?v=1525274754', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-LapisInferno-1.jpg?v=1525274754', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-LapisInferno-2.jpg?v=1525274754', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-LapisInferno-3.jpg?v=1525274754', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-LapisInferno-4.jpg?v=1525274754', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-LapisInferno-5.jpg?v=1525274754', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-LapisInferno-6.jpg?v=1525274754', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-LapisInferno-7.jpg?v=1525274754', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-Nautical-1_27a8d3ec-e6ef-44b8-8def-0915b8756914.jpg?v=1525274754']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This blue Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This solid black Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-black_27a046fe-a5d4-4309-83f3-ec11f5c61302.jpg?v=1525274766,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-black,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-black_27a046fe-a5d4-4309-83f3-ec11f5c61302.jpg?v=1525274766', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Black-1_1_e7e5be86-4a0d-4c41-ac67-b0c6f0e4ea2a.jpg?v=1525274766', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Black-2_1.jpg?v=1525274766', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Black-3_1_0e0d4316-ca64-436b-b782-c40cec07fa51.jpg?v=1525274766', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Black-4_1_5ef37097-e81f-46bc-a47b-cddd544e3448.jpg?v=1525274766', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Black-5_1_8999d1ea-262f-4453-a337-624b5108b6e9.jpg?v=1525274766', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Black-6_97587b5e-fa29-4a30-a1ec-3c478b3eace1.jpg?v=1525274766', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Black-7_fc54cd0b-e4c6-458e-8861-faa4fd382573.jpg?v=1525274766', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/blackNoodlerspens_e5f56dc4-905d-4985-b038-656257b8d6b2.jpg?v=1525274766']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a âToledo, Ohioâ engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name.Â The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It comes with a silver #6 steel nib.</p>
<p>In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.<br><br>The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.</p>

It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a âToledo, Ohioâ engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name.Â The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. ItÂ comes with a silver #6 steel nib.<br><br>In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.<br><br>The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.</p>
<p><em>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!<br><br>The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.<br><br>This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.</em></p>

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This translucent turquoise demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-truk-lagoon.jpg?v=1556717549,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-truk-lagoon,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-truk-lagoon.jpg?v=1556717549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-TrukLagoon-1_3.jpg?v=1556717549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-TrukLagoon-2_3.jpg?v=1556717549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-TrukLagoon-3_2.jpg?v=1556717549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-TrukLagoon-4_2.jpg?v=1556717549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-SeaGlass-5.jpg?v=1556717549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-MintTurquoise-8.jpg?v=1556717549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/MondayMatchup-Week41-Blog-8.jpg?v=1556717549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/MondayMatchup-Week41-Blog-4.jpg?v=1556717549']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

<p>The Duragraph draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a âToledo, Ohioâ engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name. This beautiful turquoise fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. It is complemented with silver trim and comes with a silver #6 steel nib. Each pen is individually numbered out of 1898.<br><br>In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.<br><br>The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.</p>
<p><em>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!Â </em><em>The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.Â </em><em>This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.</em></p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><em>Note: this pen is engraved with the ""Duraflex"" name, even if you are choosing a non-flex Bock nib.</em></p>

The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material.

Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation.

As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation.

It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a âToledo, Ohioâ engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name.Â The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge.Â ItÂ comes with a silver #6 steel nib.<br><br>In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.<br><br>The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.</p>
<p><em>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!<br><br>The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.<br><br>This exclusive Bock offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.</em></p>

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This translucent blue demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-creapers-cobalt.jpg?v=1525274760,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-creapers-cobalt,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-creapers-cobalt.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Cobalt-1_3.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Cobalt-2_3.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Cobalt-3_3.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Cobalt-4_3.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Cobalt-5_3.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Cobalt-6_3.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-Cobalt-7_1.jpg?v=1525274760']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. <br><br> The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. <br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! <br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>

A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
<br><br>
The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!

Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use.

It is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a âToledo, Ohioâ engraving on its nib and barrel. The cap top is embellished with the Conklin Est. 1898 logo and the cap band are engraved with the famous Duragraph model script font with three Conklin Crescent logos on either side of the model name.Â The fountain pen comes with a converter and a cartridge. ItÂ comes with a silver #6 steel nib.</p>
<p>In 1923, the Duragraph model was launched, and shortly afterwards was considered to be ""the definitive"" pen. The model was named by combining the words, durable and graph - Duragraph. Created to last as an heirloom to serve many generations, the Duragraph is offered with a lifetime guarantee. In honor of the Duragraph's 91st birthday, Conklin has introduced a new Duragraph collection that brings a fresh, modern style to a timeless oversize flat top design. Crafted from quality hand made resins, the Duragraph is substantial in size, yet not so large to be unwieldy in the hand.<br><br>The Duragraph offers the ideal choice for your individual handwriting style. The cap top mounted clip allows the pen to sit low in the pocket, making this model a more practical choice for everyday use. Each Conklin fine writing instrument is housed in a luxury gift presentation box lined with rich satin. It comes with a converter and also accepts short standard international cartridges. Ideal as a perfect gift for yourself or a loved one, this model is the right size for both men and women who use fine writing instruments in their daily professional lives.</p>

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This green Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>

It also accepts a Pilot CON-40 or CON-70 converter (sold separately). Novices will soon be on their way to becoming seasoned fountain pen users, and seasoned users will enjoy the fun, exuberant writing the Kakuno fountain pen delivers.

It is most famous for its rhodium-plated 14k gold soft nib, which provides line variation when you change your writing pressure. This solid red fountain pen has rhodium trim and includes a Con-40 converter and a Pilot/Namiki ink cartridge, packaged in a Pilot gift box.<br><br> The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. Pilot doesn't advertise this as a ""flex"" pen, though it has that reputation in the fountain pen community. It most certainly provides distinct line variation, though you can overdo it, so just be cognizant of how far you're pushing it when you flex the nib tines. <br><br> The soft extra-fine nib is quite fine, and has a very toothy feel to it though it does provide the most dramatic line variation of all the nib options. The soft-fine has quite a lot of line variation, as well, with a noticeably smoother feel than the soft extra-fine so it's ideal as an 'everyday' pen. The soft medium and soft broad are quite smooth and enjoyable to write with, though the line variation is less noticeable on these nib sizes than the finer nibs. Pilot (and other Japanese nib companies) has a reputation for grinding their nibs finer than European brands. We've found that to be the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, while the medium and broad nibs are more similar to European nibs.<br><br> The Falcon is made of black resin, a light material that polishes to a high gloss. The pen is trimmed with polished gold accents, which really complement the black color nicely. The threads on the grip are subtle, and while your fingers may touch them while you're writing, it's not bothersome at all for most writers. <br><br> This is a slightly lighter pen than most at 19g, a noticeable difference from the heavier Pilot Metal Falcon. It's well-balanced with the cap posted or not. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly.<br><br> While the Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>

While slightly different in appearance than the other LAMY steel nibs, they are indeed swappable as well. This pen comes with a matching gold-colored anodized aluminum pen case.

While slightly different in appearance than the other LAMY steel nibs, they are indeed swappable as well. This pen comes with a matching palladium-colored anodized aluminum pen case. It also comes with a blue LAMY ink cartridge so you can get started writing right away. If you'd like to use bottled fountain pen ink, you can also purchase a LAMY Z28 converter.<br><br>
<b>Note: </b>To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.</p>

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This translucent red demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-burmese-ruby.jpg?v=1525274760,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-burmese-ruby,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-burmese-ruby.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-BurmeseRuby-1_1.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-BurmeseRuby-2_1.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-BurmeseRuby-3_1.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-BurmeseRuby-4_1.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-BurmeseRuby-5_1.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-BurmeseRuby-6_1.jpg?v=1525274760', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-BurmeseRuby-7.jpg?v=1525274760']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This translucent green demonstrator Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-maximillian-emerald.jpg?v=1525274755,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-maximillian-emerald,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-maximillian-emerald.jpg?v=1525274755', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MaximillianEmerald-1.jpg?v=1525274755', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MaximillianEmerald-2.jpg?v=1525274755', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MaximillianEmerald-3.jpg?v=1525274755', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MaximillianEmerald-4.jpg?v=1525274755', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MaximillianEmerald-5.jpg?v=1525274755', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MaximillianEmerald-6.jpg?v=1525274755', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MaximillianEmerald-7.jpg?v=1525274755', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-MardiGras-6.jpg?v=1525708118']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a #6 steel nib.<br><br>The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.<br><br>During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.<br><br>The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design.<br><br><em>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!<br><br>The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.<br><br>This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.</em></p>

This white and black fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!<br><br> While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.</p>

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This green Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>

A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
<br><br>
The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-nib-creaper-ahabs-pearl.jpg?v=1548887115,noodlers-nib-creaper-flex-fountain-pen-ahabs-pearl,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-nib-creaper-ahabs-pearl.jpg?v=1548887115', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-AhabsPearl-1.jpg?v=1548887115', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-AhabsPearl-3.jpg?v=1548887115', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-AhabsPearl-4.jpg?v=1548887115', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-AhabsPearl-5.jpg?v=1548887115', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-AhabsPearl-6.jpg?v=1548887115', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-NibCreaper-AhabsPearl-7.jpg?v=1548887115']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
<br><br>
The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!

Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use.

Slightly larger and heavier than the resin Falcon, this black fountain pen pen has a soft rhodium-plated 14k gold nib that will give you line variation as you change your writing pressure. The slightly longer body has enough room to accommodate the included Pilot Con-70 converter, giving you greater ink capacity for longer writing sessions. You can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges or any other Pilot converter.<br><br>
The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. The finish of the Metal Falcon is a gloss lacquer, with a sparkly metallic color that catches the light in a subtle, yet very impressive way. The pen is trimmed with polished rhodium accents, which really complement the black color well. <br><br>
This is a slightly heavier pen than most at 33g, a noticeable difference from the lighter resin version of the Falcon. It's well-balanced though, even posted. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Metal Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's build quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>

A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.
<br><br>
The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"")  was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.
<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!
<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use.

The heavy chromium clip also is engraved with the legendary âConklinâ trademarked name and font and the center ring is engraved with the Conklin âHerringboneâ name surrounded by several Conklin crescent shapes on each side.

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This pearlescent blue Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-poseidon-pearl.jpg?v=1525274776,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-poseidon-pearl,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-poseidon-pearl.jpg?v=1525274776', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-PoseidonPearl-1_1.jpg?v=1525274776', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-PoseidonPearl-2_1.jpg?v=1525274776', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-PoseidonPearl-3_1.jpg?v=1525274776', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-PoseidonPearl-4_1.jpg?v=1525274776', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-PoseidonPearl-5_1.jpg?v=1525274776', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-PoseidonPearl-6.jpg?v=1525274776', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-PoseidonPearl-7.jpg?v=1525274776']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

This translucent yellow fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!<br><br> While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.</p>

<p><span>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</span></p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-konrad-apache-tortoise.jpg?v=1548887013,noodlers-konrad-flex-fountain-pen-apache-tortoise,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-konrad-apache-tortoise.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ApacheTortoise-1.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ApacheTortoise-3.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ApacheTortoise-4.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ApacheTortoise-5.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-ApacheTortoise-6.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-HoneyBee-4.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-Colors-1_d1914aac-1245-407a-b8d3-cfdfb2c8dfa0.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-Colors-2_e93bc1ae-0d75-4685-98b6-c73ab5727d5f.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Konrad-Colors-3_833241f8-a4e5-4ff4-ba17-8f0fe7faaa68.jpg?v=1548887013', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-HoneyBee-2_81c639c8-83f2-4a4c-85e8-dd012d98fb49.jpg?v=1548887013']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

The screw cap and barrel are carefully tapered to provide a nice balance. The trademark Rocker Clip allows users to easily secure the pen to a shirt or coat pocket. The All American comes with a threaded, standard international converter and also uses reliable (short or long) standard international cartridges. The pen comes with a silver #6 steel nib.<br><br>The Conklin Pen Company was established in 1898 and is still regarded as one of the most significant and innovative manufacturers from what is today known as the Golden Era of fountain pens.<br><br>During the 1930s, at the dawn of the depression, Conklin launched a collection that was priced more affordably to the general public. The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.<br><br>The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design.<br><br><em>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!<br><br>The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.<br><br>This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.</em></p>

The Konrad Acrylic is made of acrylic acetate.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!<br><br> While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.</p>

This translucent green fountain pen features a steel flexible nib and a twist piston mechanism with a blind cap. The Konrad is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br> The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!<br><br> While these nibs are #6 size, these Konrad pens do not accept other brands of nibs due to the shape of the interior grip.</p>

<p>The Visconti Limited Edition Opera Master Luna features a gorgeous ""Goulet blue"" resin infused with silver sparkles. This Opera Master Luna will be sold exclusively by Goulet Pens and is limited to only 188 total fountain pens, each individually numbered. It uses an oversized 23kt palladium nib, and fills via the double reservoir power filler. It comes in a large, beautiful leather pen box, along with a glass ink bottle filled with Visconti Blue ink.<br><br> In 1998, Visconti applied for the Italian patent for its Double Reservoir Power Filler, a unique filling system that allows a massive ink capacity and safe usage during air flights. Similar in operation to vacuum-filling pens (such as the larger Visconti Homo Sapiens), the Opera Master fills with a 3.4ml ink capacity in the sealed ink reservoir. Unique to this design, there is a second reservoir in between the vacuum seal and the penâs feed that holds about .6ml, the size of a typical standard international short cartridge. Effectively, what you end up with here is the ink equivalent of a standard international cartridge that you can use to write (without having to unscrew the filler knob like you do with most other vacuum-fillers), with the contents of an entire pack of cartridges (or the entire Visconti Traveling Inkwell!) in the back of your pen.<br><br> You can also customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Opera-Luna-16_9ec0b39f-e0f8-42d0-9697-202478413144.jpg?v=1556071472,visconti-opera-master-fountain-pen-luna-limited-edition,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Opera-Luna-16_9ec0b39f-e0f8-42d0-9697-202478413144.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Opera-Luna-17_6efd6a23-2b56-4f7b-aef2-964fa1a6c113.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Opera-Luna-18_673aa9b7-08eb-45b5-9d76-abe35771fb28.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Opera-Luna-20.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-1.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-2.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-10.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-11.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-3.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-4.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-5.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-6.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-9.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-12.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-13.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-OperaMaster-Luna-14.jpg?v=1556071472', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ALL-Visconti-23kt-Large-EF-ST_a3b89887-09d7-4b29-9607-7348581596f1.jpg?v=1556071487']",2018-06-05 11:59:51-04:00

This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. <br><br> The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. <br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! <br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>

Slightly larger and heavier than the resin Falcon, this pale blue fountain pen pen has a soft rhodium-plated 14k gold nib that will give you line variation as you change your writing pressure. The slightly longer body has enough room to accommodate the included Pilot Con-70 converter, giving you greater ink capacity for longer writing sessions. You can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges or any other Pilot converter.<br><br>
The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. The finish of the Metal Falcon is a gloss lacquer, with a sparkly metallic color that catches the light in a subtle, yet very impressive way. The pen is trimmed with polished rhodium accents. <br><br>
This is a slightly heavier pen than most at 33g, a noticeable difference from the lighter resin version of the Falcon. It's well-balanced though, even posted. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Metal Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's build quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>

The pen features a super smooth steel nib, and accepts cartridges or a converter (included). The copper will patina on the pen over time (unless polished - cloth included), creating a unique look to you.<br><br> Since 1912, for more than a century, Montegrappa has been manufacturing high-quality writing instruments in the same historic building in Bassano del Grappa, North East Italy. Within a stoneâs throw of the Montegrappa works â home of the oldest pen manufacture in Italy â is the heart of another industry. Grappa is the local tipple, and it has never been more popular, finding new friends in bars and saloons from Mumbai to Manhattan to Macau. Following the success of the spectacular limited edition Grappa pen in hammered copper, Montegrappa again honors the localsâ favorite beverage with a pen inspired by both the drink and the equipment that distills it. <br><br> Featuring a shape that is classic Montegrappa, curvaceous yet sleekly contemporary, the Montegrappa Mule pen collection further displays its familial links with a cap top bearing the famous ""1912"" logo, while the nib is embellished with a filigree Montegrappa pattern. The cap and barrel are crafted in mirror-polished copper, further defined by a brushed silver-plated trim. The effect recalls the well-used, vintage piping and tubing employed in the process of producing grappa. Over the time, each Montegrappa Mule will acquire its own unique patina through handling by its fond owner, truly personalizing the writing instrument. Easily recyclable without any loss of property, copper is a naturally hygienic metal that slows down the growth of germs. It is widely used in food preparation and health equipment, as well as in design and various artistic forms.<br><br> Merely honoring the grappa tradition would be enough to explain the design of the Montegrappa Mule, but Montegrappaâs creativity has been imbued with the spirit of the â¦ spirit! Initially inspired by the classic Moscow Mule cocktail, traditionally served in a copper mug, Montegrappa has registered an exciting new grappa-based cocktail. Created by famous Bassano-based mixologists, brothers Edoardo and Leone Miotti, the recipe is specially developed and already featured on the cocktail menu of Bar Danieli. The Montegrappa Mule will be sipped with relish during the promotion of the pen at various sippingânâsampling bar and in-store events. The drink itself is made of 40Â° premium-quality grappa, bergamot scents and a habanero-chilli pepper twist.</p>

Slightly larger and heavier than the resin Falcon, this burgundy red fountain pen pen has a soft rhodium-plated 14k gold nib that will give you line variation as you change your writing pressure. The slightly longer body has enough room to accommodate the included Pilot Con-70 converter, giving you greater ink capacity for longer writing sessions. You can also use proprietary Pilot ink cartridges or any other Pilot converter.<br><br>
The softness of the nib is such that if you want to use it for daily writing you can, without having to flex it out. Though if you do want to showcase line variation, all you need to do is increase your writing pressure on the downstrokes and it's there for when you need it. The finish of the Metal Falcon is a gloss lacquer, with a sparkly metallic color that catches the light in a subtle, yet very impressive way. The pen is trimmed with polished rhodium accents.<br><br>
This is a slightly heavier pen than most at 33g, a noticeable difference from the lighter resin version of the Falcon. It's well-balanced though, even posted. The screw-cap pushes on the back of the pen to post, and holds very firmly. While the Metal Falcon is certainly an investment, if you appreciate Pilot's build quality and are looking for a reliable soft nib in a professional-looking pen, then you should give this pen a serious look.</p>

If you'd like, you can even remove the piston mechanism and use the pen as an eyedropper for a massive 6ml ink capacity. This pearlescent red Ahab is made of a celluloid derivative and is technically biodegradable and formed from a ""renewable resource"". The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors.<br><br>
The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.<br><br>
As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!<br><br>
Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-mars-pearl.jpg?v=1525274777,noodlers-ahab-flex-fountain-pen-mars-pearl,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/nw-noodlers-ahab-mars-pearl.jpg?v=1525274777', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MarsPearl-1_1.jpg?v=1525274777', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MarsPearl-2_1.jpg?v=1525274777', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MarsPearl-3_1.jpg?v=1525274777', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MarsPearl-4_1.jpg?v=1525274777', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MarsPearl-5_1.jpg?v=1525274777', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MarsPearl-6.jpg?v=1525274777', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-Ahab-MarsPearl-7.jpg?v=1525274777', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ThursdayThings-Berry_1.jpg?v=1525274777']",2018-01-01 11:00:00-05:00

The Aurora Ipsilon, with its unmistakably shaped clip, is a loyal everyday companion dedicated to those who work and study. The barrel and cap are made of a bordeaux red resin with gold-plated accents and a matching gold-plated steel nib. This fountain pen comes with an Aurora blue ink cartridge and an Aurora converter in a black gift box.<br><br> A light and well-balanced snap-cap pen, the Ipsilon is a great every day carry pen. With a toothier nib, this pen is ideal for those who like to feel their pen on the paper.<br><br> <i>Brian's thoughts: </i><br>The Ipsilon writes differently than most other fountain pens you may have used. They're intentionally toothy, meaning that they have a pretty noticeable amount of feedback (resistance) as you write. This is especially the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, which are actually quite narrow in line width and a little dry. There's a pretty noticeable jump in size between the fine and medium, so if you like wetter/smoother nibs, going with a medium or broad will be the way to go. The italic nib is actually more of a true italic, meaning that the edges are crisper than you typically see coming from any other pen company I've seen (typically, to get italics this crisp you have to get it custom ground). The italic can take some getting used to, so don't despair if you need to practice a bit, it's very sensitive to rotation in your hand. Get the hang of it though and you have a wet and crisp italic like I've seen from no other company!</p>

Like the other Platinum #3776 Century fountain pens, the Nice Lilas has the ""Slip and Seal"" cap mechanism that prevents the ink from drying out as well as the newly redesigned nib and feed to regulate the ink flow. The first 2000 pens will come with an individually numbered blotter card,  then ongoing it will be a regular offering.</p>

The Aurora Ipsilon, with its unmistakably shaped clip, is a loyal everyday companion dedicated to those who work and study. The barrel and cap are made of a green resin with gold-plated accents and a matching gold-plated steel nib. This fountain pen comes with an Aurora blue ink cartridge and an Aurora converter in a black gift box.<br><br> A light and well-balanced snap-cap pen, the Ipsilon is a great every day carry pen. With a toothier nib, this pen is ideal for those who like to feel their pen on the paper.<br><br> <i>Brian's thoughts: </i><br>The Ipsilon writes differently than most other fountain pens you may have used. They're intentionally toothy, meaning that they have a pretty noticeable amount of feedback (resistance) as you write. This is especially the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, which are actually quite narrow in line width and a little dry. There's a pretty noticeable jump in size between the fine and medium, so if you like wetter/smoother nibs, going with a medium or broad will be the way to go. The italic nib is actually more of a true italic, meaning that the edges are crisper than you typically see coming from any other pen company I've seen (typically, to get italics this crisp you have to get it custom ground). The italic can take some getting used to, so don't despair if you need to practice a bit, it's very sensitive to rotation in your hand.

A small ink window shows how much ink is left in your pen. These pens are made from a celluloid derivative. The vegetal resin body of this pen may show particles or striations within the material. This is most noticeable in demonstrators and bright colors. <br><br> The Nib Creaper (also known as the ""Standard Flex Pen"") was the first fountain pen produced by Noodler's, introduced in 2010. The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen. <br><br> As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice! <br><br> Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>

Lavande means lavender in French. It comes with a Platinum ink cartridge and a converter for use with bottled ink, and it features a 14k rose gold nib.<br><br>
Like the other Platinum #3776 Century fountain pens, the Nice Lavande has the ""Slip and Seal"" cap mechanism that prevents the ink from drying out as well as the newly redesigned nib and feed to regulate the ink flow.<br><br>
Nice is a world-renowned resort and tourist city located in Cote dâAzur in southern France. In early summer, Province region experiences its most beautiful season, with blooming fields of lavender that stretch all the way to the horizon. ""Lavande"" is the French word for lavender, which was the inspiration for this new color of pen.<br><br>
The light purple lavender flowers, gently blowing in the early summer wind and bathed in soft light, are expressed through a sandblast finish applied on the high transparency resin barrel. Thereafter, sharp accent lines are added through shaper cutting. The pen also features an exquisite pink gold metal trim.<br><br>
Lavande, the French word for lavender, is said to be the ""queen of herbs,"" which is highly fragrant and has been prized as a medicinal herb since ancient Roman times for its healing effect. In flower language, lavender denotes ""silence"" due to the tranquilizing effect as well as its magically strong scent. As the flower language implies, this Lavande fountain pen creates a sense of calm, inviting one to breathe deeply into writing, making it unique among other Nice models.<br><br>
The first 3000 pens will come with an individually numbered blotter card,  then ongoing it will be a regular offering.</p>

The Aurora Ipsilon, with its unmistakably shaped clip, is a loyal everyday companion dedicated to those who work and study. The barrel and cap are made of a matte blue resin with silver accents and a matching steel nib. This fountain pen comes with an Aurora blue ink cartridge and an Aurora converter in a black gift box.<br><br> A light and well-balanced snap-cap pen, the Ipsilon is a great every day carry pen. With a toothier nib, this pen is ideal for those who like to feel their pen on the paper.<br><br> <i>Brian's thoughts: </i><br>The Ipsilon writes differently than most other fountain pens you may have used. They're intentionally toothy, meaning that they have a pretty noticeable amount of feedback (resistance) as you write. This is especially the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, which are actually quite narrow in line width and a little dry. There's a pretty noticeable jump in size between the fine and medium, so if you like wetter/smoother nibs, going with a medium or broad will be the way to go. The italic nib is actually more of a true italic, meaning that the edges are crisper than you typically see coming from any other pen company I've seen (typically, to get italics this crisp you have to get it custom ground). The italic can take some getting used to, so don't despair if you need to practice a bit, it's very sensitive to rotation in your hand. Get the hang of it though and you have a wet and crisp italic like I've seen from no other company!</p>

Created by pursuing a transparency like clear waters, this new fountain pen has been named after Oshino Hakkai, which is a famous destination for the beautiful springs sourced from the underground water of Mount Fuji.

The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.<br><br>The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design.</p>

The Aurora Ipsilon, with its unmistakably shaped clip, is a loyal everyday companion dedicated to those who work and study. The barrel and cap are made of a matte black resin with silver accents and a steel nib. This fountain pen comes with an Aurora blue ink cartridge and an Aurora converter in a black gift box.<br><br> A light and well-balanced snap-cap pen, the Ipsilon is a great every day carry pen. With a toothier nib, this pen is ideal for those who like to feel their pen on the paper.<br><br> <i>Brian's thoughts: </i><br>The Ipsilon writes differently than most other fountain pens you may have used. They're intentionally toothy, meaning that they have a pretty noticeable amount of feedback (resistance) as you write. This is especially the case with the extra-fine and fine nibs, which are actually quite narrow in line width and a little dry. There's a pretty noticeable jump in size between the fine and medium, so if you like wetter/smoother nibs, going with a medium or broad will be the way to go. The italic nib is actually more of a true italic, meaning that the edges are crisper than you typically see coming from any other pen company I've seen (typically, to get italics this crisp you have to get it custom ground). The italic can take some getting used to, so don't despair if you need to practice a bit, it's very sensitive to rotation in your hand. Get the hang of it though and you have a wet and crisp italic like I've seen from no other company!</p>

This blue Brenta di Notte fountain pen is a limited production run of 300 pens, and isÂ our thirdÂ exclusive launch of this model to the world, following the successful Rosso Ciliegia red and Verde Altipiano green.<br><br>A world leader in the creation of fine writing instruments, since the Renaissance, Italy championed the fountain pen through the craftsmanship of Elmo. This was the name initially used from 1927 by Montegrappa, the world leader in the creation of the perfect tools for creating missives, jotting notes, producing a signature with a flourish. After an absence of almost 75 years, Elmo returns as a pen conceived to reawaken a love for penmanship, with charms to lure a generation more accustomed to texting. <br><br>Our third exclusive Elmo model comes in a dark blue resin.Â  The name of this pen, Brenta di Notte, is inspired by the blue waters of the Brenta river at night. The Brenta is an river that runs from the north in Trentino to the Veneto region. Thus Brenta di Notte â translated as Brenta at nightÂ <span>âÂ </span>connects the color to the iconic river and its place in Bassano del Grappa, the home of Montegrappa.Â </p>
<p>Every Elmo pen boasts the design values of the era that gave us the most elegant fashions and the most beautiful motorcars, a decade that to this day continues to influence architecture and fashion: the 1930s and the Art Deco movement that defined it. The Elmo pen therefore exhibits a classic form, ergonomically ideal for the smoothest writing sensation, but so chic that it deserves to be regarded as an objet dâart as much as it is a fine instrument.<br><br>In common with its Montegrappa siblings, the Elmo pen is made of the finest materials, is offered as a cartridge/converter fountain pen with a #6 JoWo steel nib. It includes a converter and two black Montegrappa short standard international ink cartridges. Each penâs pocket clip terminates in a rolling ball to facilitate ingress and egress from oneâs pocket. As a final touch, the penâsÂ cap is subtly engraved with theÂ contemporary logo of Montegrappa, in a complementary tone.</p>

<p>The Koloro is a traditional Japanese style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the ebonite blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Koloroâs impressive ink capacity. Having the translucent resin portions of the pen allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.</p>

The ""All American"" collection was offered in a variety of sizes, filling mechanisms and finishes with the aim of satisfying a growing market demand for good quality, but affordably priced writing instruments. Today this pen pays homage to the classic designs of the vintage Conklin era.<br><br>The All American collection draws its inspiration from the rich heritage of the Conklin brand, which was purchased and revived by Yafa in 2009. The rebooted All American is manufactured in Asia, assembled and distributed from Canoga Park, California, and pays tribute to its roots with a ""Toledo, Ohio"" engraving on its nib and barrel. This collection brings a vibrant, contemporary style to a classic, oversize streamlined design. <br><br><em>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!<br><br>The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.<br><br>This exclusive offering only applies to the Extra-Fine, Fine, and Medium nibs, and does not apply to the Omniflex nibs.</em></p>

<p><i>From Montegrappa:</i><br><br> Inspiration comes to us at Montegrappa from a variety of sources and places and events and objects. All celebrate some aspect of life, and what enriches it. In the wake of the great success of the Mule line, inspired by a famous cocktail, we looked again at another favourite tipple, the Blue Blazer. <br><br> An enticing mix of scotch, boiling water and powdered sugar, the Blue Blazer earns its incendiary name from the theatre that accompanies it: the drink is set alight. Celebrating its 155th birthday this year, the Blue Blazer is said to be the first cocktail to undergo the touch of the flame. Most distinctively, the drink is prepared with two large tankards, between which the stream of flame travels. <br><br> Our Montegrappa Blazer is based on the Fortuna shape, but with its cap and body made, appropriately, of fire-burnished stainless steel with a vintage-looking brushed silver trim. The polished steel surface of the pen barrel and cap basks in bluish, iridescent shades, just as a heated metal would do.</p>

In Greek mythology the Titans were divine beings thought to personify the Earth and the Sky or Heavens. <br><br> In this special edition pen, we created a gentle band of luminescent glow-in-the-dark blue that fades into a darker pool of deep purple. Across this background a cascade of glittering stars provides a unique impression of the heavens in each pen.<br><br> Graphic and flamboyant, the pens from the Hexagon collection features the pattern of natureâs most perfect six-sided polygon shapes. Aesthetically pleasing, balanced, and harmonious, with its seamless symmetry and balance, Hexagons are the true inspirations for those who prefer edgy geometry design. A striking contrast of the austere pattern and madly vivid color palette complete the pensâ incomparable style.</p>

The triangular rubberized ergonomic grip helps you properly hold the pen, ideal especially for beginners. The body of the pen features an ink window so that you can see when your ink is getting low. The stylus tip on the back of the pen glides lightly and conductively over the capacitive screens of smartphones and tablet PCs, and the back of the barrel has a bit of texture to serve as a grip section when using the pen as a stylus.</p>
<p>This fountain pen comes with one blue standard international fitted proprietary ink cartridge and includes the smaller clear Standard International converter commonly known as ONLINE or Monteverde Artista Crystal. It will not fit a full size converter due to the diameter of the converter not fitting inside the body of the pen. The black steel nib comes with a 5 year guarantee. Each individual pen represents tested quality â Made in Germany.</p>

A smooth and pleasant texture has been achieved by applying a blast processing while the surface reflection has been softened to produce an impression as if the pen is covered by mist, from which the name ""Black Mist"" comes. <br><br> By putting an extra effort in the surface finishing, ""Black Mist"" adds a new look to the Plaisir series. It matches perfectly with digital tools such as smartphones, personal computers and digital cameras, enabling a wide range of use both at work and leisure.</p>

Gold leafs and pink Kanazawa leafs are used to portray the scene.<br><br> The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.</p>

Safety pens are designed to help prevent any ink from leaking while capped. Unlike traditional fountain pens that seal around the grip when closed, the safety pen helps to create a seal right at the ink reservoir. They are not as vulnerable to pressure changes when traveling. They also start right up after periods of non-use due to the fact that the nib and feed stay submerged in ink when retracted.</p>
<p>When you first open it, you will notice that the nib is completely retracted into the barrel. To expose the nib, simply push and twist on the back of the pen, keeping the pen in a vertical position with the nib facing up. <b><i>This is important! Otherwise the entirety of the ink supply will pour out of the pen. </i></b>Slowly twist and push all the way up.</p>
<p>To fill this pen, retract the nib fully back into the barrel of the pen, and fill using an eyedropper or an ink syringe with no more than 1ml (to avoid overfilling and spillage).</p>
<p>To close the pen, you will need to retract the nib back into the barrel, keeping it vertical with the nib facing up, before screwing the cap back on.</p>
<p><b><i>We strongly recommend that you watch Nathanâs video below on best practices for using and filling this pen, as it is unlike anything else we carry.</i></b></p>
<p>It uses a #2 flexible nib, the same as the Noodlerâs Nib Creaper flex pen.</p>
<p>The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.</p>
<p>As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!</p>
<p>Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Chestnut-1.jpg?v=1547520732,noodlers-boston-safety-pen-chestnut,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Chestnut-1.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Chestnut-2.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Chestnut-3.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Chestnut-4.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Chestnut-5.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-SafetyPen-Graphic_aac79b50-f6ff-4220-8c90-da12e1eccd28.jpg?v=1535384428', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-SafetyPen-Chestnut-6.jpg?v=1535384432', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/NibNook-Noodlers-SafetyPen-Flex_75422618-f54c-422e-a35b-53f4f647ede5.jpg?v=1535394722']",2018-08-29 09:16:56-04:00

Safety pens are designed to help prevent any ink from leaking while capped. Unlike traditional fountain pens that seal around the grip when closed, the safety pen helps to create a seal right at the ink reservoir. They are not as vulnerable to pressure changes when traveling. They also start right up after periods of non-use due to the fact that the nib and feed stay submerged in ink when retracted.</p>
<p>When you first open it, you will notice that the nib is completely retracted into the barrel. To expose the nib, simply push and twist on the back of the pen, keeping the pen in a vertical position with the nib facing up. <b><i>This is important! Otherwise the entirety of the ink supply will pour out of the pen. </i></b>Slowly twist and push all the way up.</p>
<p>To fill this pen, retract the nib fully back into the barrel of the pen, and fill using an eyedropper or an ink syringe with no more than 1ml (to avoid overfilling and spillage).</p>
<p>To close the pen, you will need to retract the nib back into the barrel, keeping it vertical with the nib facing up, before screwing the cap back on.</p>
<p><b><i>We strongly recommend that you watch Nathanâs video below on best practices for using and filling this pen, as it is unlike anything else we carry.</i></b></p>
<p>It uses a #2 flexible nib, the same as the Noodlerâs Nib Creaper flex pen.</p>
<p>The Noodler's flex pens were designed for the hands-on tinkerer - they are made to be taken apart and adjusted. The nib and feed pull right out and can be adjusted and heat set for optimal performance. Don't be afraid to get a little ink on your fingers while you learn how to use this pen.</p>
<p>As a simple rule of thumb for writing with a flex pen, just apply slight pressure on your downstrokes, which will spread the tines and increase the line width, achieving that optimal line variation. Make sure to go slowly so that the ink can keep up with your writing. As with any flex pen, it just takes practice!</p>
<p>Due to the residual machining oils used when cutting the feeds for these pens, we highly encourage you to give the pen a good flush before use. We recommend any of the following options: distilled water, water with a touch of dish soap, a pre-packaged pen flush, or a solution of 10% clear ammonia to water. This should resolve most ink flow issues!</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Black-1.jpg?v=1547520732,noodlers-boston-safety-pen-black,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Black-1.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Black-2.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Black-3.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Black-4.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-BostonSafetyPen-Black-5.jpg?v=1547520732', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-SafetyPen-Graphic.jpg?v=1540573116', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-SafetyPen-Black-6.jpg?v=1540573116', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-SafetyPen-4.jpg?v=1540573116', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Noodlers-SafetyPen-5.jpg?v=1540573116', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/NibNook-Noodlers-SafetyPen-Flex.jpg?v=1540573116']",2018-08-29 09:16:56-04:00

<p><span>Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.</span></p>
<p><strong>UltraResin:</strong></p>
<p><span>Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.</span></p>
<p><span>Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.<br><br>Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.<br><br><b>GlueLess Technology:</b></span></p>
<p><span>To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.<br><br><b>Cap Lock:</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Clip:</b></span></p>
<p><span>A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Band:</b></span></p>
<p><span>Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free.Â <br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Nib:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong>Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineiderâs interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firmâs illustrious name.</span></p>
<p><span>This pen comes with a standard international converter, and also accepts standard international cartridges.Â </span></p>

Part of the new Gemstones collection, this Rodolite Red fountain pen features a red hand-blended resin and marble body, a quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's âsoft touch magnetic lockâ cap system. This fountain pen fills via standard international cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes.<br><br> This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible.<br><br> Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.<br><br> <em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.</em></p>

This fountain pen features an eight-sided polished acrylic resin, accented with silver chrome. It opens/closes via a magnetic snap-cap, and fills via internal piston mechanism.Â ItÂ comes with a silver #6 steel nib.</p>
<p>Conklin, the legendary name for fine writing instruments, returns with a revitalized design of a timeless classic, the Nozac piston filler. Originally released in 1931, Conklin took the world by storm with their patented piston-filler and polygonal design. The Conklin Nozac (""no sack"") was the only American piston-filler in production at the time.<br><br> Exceptional to look at and even better in hand, the Nozac is as unique as it is stunning. Based on the original model, the new Nozac fountain pen is machined to perfection and painstakingly hand-polished. The body features eight smooth faceted sides, and is then adorned with striking silver along the clip, grip, and ends. Made from European grade acrylic resin, each fountain pen displays a wide variety of color. The Ohio Blue is a dazzling shade of true blue, marbled with shades of white, silver, and greens.<br><br> New to Conklin, each cap is magnetized along the barrel and innermost lining, for a secure closure, whether at the office or traveling. Similar to winding watches, to fill the fountain pen you simply move the filling mechanism forward by twisting the knob (non-ending screw) located at the back of the pen. Draw ink into the barrel by twisting the knob in the opposite direction, creating the vacuum that draws the ink through the nib.</p>
<p>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience!

This fountain pen features an eight-sided polished acrylic resin, accented with silver chrome. It opens/closes via a magnetic snap-cap, and fills via internal piston mechanism.Â ItÂ comes with a silver #6 steel nib.</p>
<p>Conklin, the legendary name for fine writing instruments, returns with a revitalized design of a timeless classic, the Nozac piston filler. Originally released in 1931, Conklin took the world by storm with their patented piston-filler and polygonal design. The Conklin Nozac (""no sack"") was the only American piston-filler in production at the time.<br><br> Exceptional to look at and even better in hand, the Nozac is as unique as it is stunning. Based on the original model, the new Nozac fountain pen is machined to perfection and painstakingly hand-polished. The body features eight smooth faceted sides, and is then adorned with striking silver along the clip, grip, and ends. Made from European grade acrylic resin, each fountain pen displays a wide variety of color. The Toledo Red is a stunning shade of dark maroon marbled with a mix of colors, flecked with purple, gold, blue, or orange.<br><br> New to Conklin, each cap is magnetized along the barrel and innermost lining, for a secure closure, whether at the office or traveling. Similar to winding watches, to fill the fountain pen you simply move the filling mechanism forward by twisting the knob (non-ending screw) located at the back of the pen. Draw ink into the barrel by twisting the knob in the opposite direction, creating the vacuum that draws the ink through the nib.</p>
<p>We are excited to exclusively offer this pen with a German-made nib from Bock. For over 75 years Bock has been manufacturing parts for fine writing instruments and weâre confident that youâll love how these nibs enhance your writing experience! The Bock logo will be imprinted on the nib rather than the imprint shown in the photo, and will not have an imprint to note the nib size.

This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink.<br><br> A tree leaf turning red in autumn is floating in a little stream. The changing color of the autumn leaf are delicately and beautifully portrayed with the use of ""scattered leaf technique"" applied to gold and colored leafs.<br><br> The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.</p>

This fountain pen fills via standard international cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes.<br><br> This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible.<br><br> Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.<br><br> <em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.</em></p>

Featuring a sharp alternating material scheme of blueÂ ebonite and resin, this penâs design stands on its own.</p>
<p>The Koloro is a traditional Japanese style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the ebonite blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Koloroâs impressive ink capacity. Having the translucent resin portions of the pen allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.</p>
<p>The Koloro features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-1.jpg?v=1547520739,opus-88-koloro-fountain-pen-blue,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-1.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-2.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-3.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-4.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-5.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-6.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/koloro-blue3.JPG?v=1528830464', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-12.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-11.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-7.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-8.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-9.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Blue-10.jpg?v=1547520739', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ALL-Opus-88-Steel-New_1c63009e-b3cb-4aab-949b-ca1074137a2b.jpg?v=1528830464']",2018-05-31 15:51:46-04:00

<p><strong></strong>The Pineider La Grande Bellezza, or The Great Beauty, is a new collection of fountain pens made in Italy designed by Dante DelÂ Vecchio. Part of the new Gemstones collection, this Lapis Blue fountain pen features a blue hand-blended resin and marble body, a quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's âsoft touch magnetic lockâ cap system. This fountain pen fills via standard international cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes.<br><br>This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible.<br><br> Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.<br><br> <em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.</em></p>

This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink.<br><br> A variety of different techniques of applying a gold leaf are used in depicting ""the moon and autumn grasses"" while delicate silver lines realistically portray the rabbit on silver leaf.<br><br> The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.</p>

Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Horn resin has silver and grey swirls. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a âmirageâ or an optical illusion. It features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.<br><br>Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.â<br><br>This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.</p>
<p>You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><span>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</span></p>

<p><span>Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.</span></p>
<p><strong>UltraResin:</strong></p>
<p><span>Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.</span></p>
<p><span>Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.<br><br>Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.<br><br><b>GlueLess Technology:</b></span></p>
<p><span>To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.<br><br><b>Cap Lock:</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Clip:</b></span></p>
<p><span>A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Band:</b></span></p>
<p><span>Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free.Â <br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Nib:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong>Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineiderâs interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firmâs illustrious name.</span></p>

In those days, portable pens were an emerging technology full of problems and still looking for broad acceptance as knowledge and networking tools.<br><br> Helm was the first technical director of the company, a figure with a hard work and an optimism that reminds today's technology entrepreneurs. His know-how and his charisma inspired the young company to give its name to their first products, and Elmo pens would become the cornerstones of Italian offices and schools in the coming years.<br><br> The Montegrappa Elmo is a compact, round pen that recalls the international style popularized by the Bauhaus in the 1920s. During that time, Helm led his company away from the archetypes of diving pens and designed new solutions to meet contemporary lifestyles. Portability, reliability and efficiency were his mantra.<br><br> In 2019, writing instruments are again sought after as essential objects for everyday use (EDC) and the Elmo model is among the first pens produced in Europe to meet this need. Crafted in resin with stainless steel hardware, it offers robust, all-round performance, honest simplicity and a century of know-how in prestigious stationery.<br><br> The Montegrappa Elmo fountain pen comes with a #6 JoWo steel nib and includes a converter and cartridge. Each penâs pocket clip terminates in a rolling ball to facilitate ingress and egress from oneâs pocket. As a final touch, the penâsÂ cap is subtly engraved with theÂ contemporaryÂ logo of Montegrappa.</p>

<p>An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Picnic's impressive ink capacity.Â </p>

The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a âmirageâ or an optical illusion. It features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully.

The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.â<br><br>This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.</p>
<p>You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.</p>

Featuring a sharp alternating material scheme of red ebonite and resin, this penâs design stands on its own.</p>
<p>The Koloro is a traditional Japanese style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut-off valve. An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the ebonite blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Koloroâs impressive ink capacity. Having the translucent resin portions of the pen allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped.</p>
<p>The Koloro features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib and includes a glass eyedropper to fill the pen with your favorite ink.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-1.jpg?v=1554304256,opus-88-koloro-fountain-pen-red,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-1.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-2.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-3.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-4.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-5.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-6.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/koloro-red3.JPG?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-11.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-7.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-8.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-9.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Koloro-Red-10.jpg?v=1554304256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ARTH-EdwardHopper_43ac3263-f925-430d-8e7d-eefd3457d7fb.jpg?v=1556136380', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ALL-Opus-88-Steel-New_25a31d8c-1045-45c7-891c-65a5df1dc0fa.jpg?v=1554304256']",2018-05-31 15:51:48-04:00

This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink.<br><br> Movements of ripples are exquisitely depicted by changing colors of ripples from gold to silver. The goldfish in vermillion reinforces the dynamic impression.<br><br> The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.</p>

This fountain pen has a firm 18k gold nib and a very smooth stroke. It accepts proprietary Platinum ink cartridges or a Platinum converter (both are included) for filling with bottled ink.<br><br> An auspicious Mt. Fuji tinged with red at sunrise is expressed with a Kanazawa gold leaf of red color. Golden clouds shining in the sun are depicted with a combination of gold and silver leafs.<br><br> The use of 18k gold makes the tip of the pen firm and resilient, instead of making it too soft. Special attention is also given to the thickness of the pen tip: the base of the tip is thin and becomes thicker toward the end of the tip, which provides the tip with a perfect balance between appropriate resilience and the ease of writing. The comfort of writing without the application of much pressure on the tip has been pursued and brought to a reality as a result of data analysis of about 30,000 writing materials. Meticulous efforts are focused on the materialization of the ease of grip and comfort of writing.</p>

<p><span>Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.</span></p>
<p><strong>UltraResin:</strong></p>
<p><span>Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.</span></p>
<p><span>Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.<br><br>Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.<br><br><b>GlueLess Technology:</b></span></p>
<p><span>To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.<br><br><b>Cap Lock:</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Clip:</b></span></p>
<p><span>A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Band:</b></span></p>
<p><span>Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free.Â <br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Nib:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong>Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineiderâs interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firmâs illustrious name.</span></p>
<p><span>This pen comes with a standard international converter, and also accepts standard international cartridges.Â </span></p>

<p>The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neonÂ purple<span>Â </span>fountain penÂ features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, andÂ it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.</p>
<p>Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.</p>
<p>The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.</li>
<li>Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.</li>
<li>Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.</li>
<li>New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.</li>
<li>New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</p>

<p>The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neonÂ green fountain penÂ features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, andÂ it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.</p>
<p>Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.</p>
<p>The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.</li>
<li>Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.</li>
<li>Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.</li>
<li>New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.</li>
<li>New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</p>

Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.<br><br> <em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.</em></p>

It is a traditional Japanese-style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut off value. TheÂ brown tinted demonstrator body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped. The Picnic features chrome hardware and a stainless steelÂ #5 JoWo nib.</p>
<p>An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Picnic's impressive ink capacity.Â </p>

It fills via Visconti's power filler, closes via the hook-safe-lock system, and features the oversized 23kt palladium nib. Only 188 pieces are available worldwide.<br><br> Lorenzo de' Medici (1449-1492 Firenze) the Prince of Princes, was an Italian statesman and the ""de facto ruler"" of the Florentine Republic, who was the most powerful and enthusiastic patron of the Renaissance. Also known as Lorenzo il Magnifico (the Magnificent) by his contemporary Florentines, he was a magnate, diplomat, politician and patron of scholars, artists and poets. He is well known for his contribution to the art world by sponsoring artists such as Botticelli and Michelangelo. His life coincided with the mature phase of Italian Renaissance. As natural evolution of the Medici collection, Visconti is proud to dedicate a special limited edition to the great statesman of the 15th Century.<br><br> The pen embodies the essence of the Renaissance period, combining exclusive and precious elements. Another magnificent masterpiece from Visconti symbolic of the power of the Medici family over the rest of the known world. The cap is in solid 925 Sterling Silver finely chiseled with the old techniques handed down from Benvenuto Cellini, the most prestigious jeweler of the 15th Century. The motifs chiseled on the cap and repeated on the blind cap are lilies, symbols of Florence. The top of the cap is enriched with the ancient coat of arms of the Medici family with six balls. The body is the central heart of the pen in solid Levanto reddish marble.

<p><span>Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.</span></p>
<p><strong>UltraResin:</strong></p>
<p><span>Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.</span></p>
<p><span>Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.<br><br>Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.<br><br><b>GlueLess Technology:</b></span></p>
<p><span>To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.<br><br><b>Cap Lock:</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Clip:</b></span></p>
<p><span>A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Band:</b></span></p>
<p><span>Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free.Â <br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Nib:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong>Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineiderâs interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firmâs illustrious name.</span></p>
<p><span>This pen comes with a standard international converter, and also accepts standard international cartridges.Â </span></p>

The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.</p>

It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. <br><br>Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.</p>

<p>Inspired by the Chateau de Chenonceau in Loire in France, also known as the ""castle of six ladies,""Â which was owned and loved by six noblewomen through the centuries, the new color Chenonceau White expresses the image of the white, elegant look of the castle. Its soft ivory color matches well with the gold finish, highlighting its grace. Being constructed over the river, the chateau and the waters create an exceptional scenery, which suites the image of the #3776 series that retains moisture of the ink over time thanks to the Slip &amp; Seal Mechanism. It isÂ Platinum's hope that the elegant and luxurious Chenonceau White color, which was created in pursuit of a white tone that can be well-received both by men and women, adds a distinctive presence in your life.</p>

The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging includes a sample of Pineider luxury stationery cards and envelopes.<br><br> This new material is resin-based, but with an high percentage of marble dust. The marble dust was added for three reasons: to make a harder compound to increase the shining of each colors with an high gloss polish, to increase the specific weight of the material to make it more consistent, and to achieve the range of colors. The result is incredible.<br><br> Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.<br><br> <em>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material there will be some variation in the pattern seen here. This adds an element of uniqueness to the pen, with no two patterns being exactly the same.</em></p>

Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Night Blue resin is a dark blue with swirls of light blue. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a âmirageâ or an optical illusion. It features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.<br><br>Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.â<br><br>This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.</p>
<p>You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.</p>

<p><strong></strong>The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip.</p>
<p>ThisÂ green resin fountain pen hasÂ gold-plated trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. <br><br>Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933.

It is a traditional Japanese-style eyedropper-filled pen with a piston operated shut off value. The blue tinted demonstrator body allows you to see both your current ink level and your nib while capped. The Picnic features chrome hardware and a stainless steel #5 JoWo nib.</p>
<p>An ebonite piston and rubber gasket seals the feed off from the barrel when fully depressed, reducing the risk of leakage and burping. By unscrewing the blind cap and loosening the rod at the rear of the barrel, you open up the ink flow to the feed. During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the Picnic's impressive ink capacity.</p>

This neonÂ pink fountain penÂ features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, andÂ it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.</p>
<p>Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.</p>
<p>The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.</li>
<li>Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.</li>
<li>Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.</li>
<li>New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.</li>
<li>New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.</li>
</ul>

When darkness falls across Florence, the city reveals aspects of its beauty not shown in daylight. Street corners and buildings change identity as they are shaded by a multitude of darker tones of gray, blue and purple.</p>
<p>The Visconti team has worked hard to replicate these beautiful colors in a new unique resin palette throughout the pens body and cap. The barrel of the pen features ribbons and swirls of shaved acryloid, suspended in a clear acrylic resin while the cap and plunger feature the same colors fixed into in a marbleized navy blue resin. All trims are crafted in 925 sterling silver.</p>
<p>The pen caps using the Visconti 'Hook Safe Lock', a revolutionary capping system so you can cap a pen without worrying about the cap accidentally unscrewing in your pocket and leaking. The fountain pen features Visconti's patented Double Reservoir Power Filler, a unique filling system that allows a greater ink capacity and safe usage during air flights. The vacuum power filler is made of titanium to resist ink corrosion, and it comes equipped with Visconti's 23kt Dreamtouch palladium nib.</p>
<p>The Midnight in Florence Limited Edition series is individually numbered and limited to 888 pens worldwide. <br><br> Note: Each of these pens has a different pattern and consistency of swirls. We do our best to photograph a pen thatâs indicative of the average overall aesthetics, but expect some variance when you receive yours. Itâll be one-of-a-kind, just like your unique writing style!</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-1.jpg?v=1555960631,visconti-homo-sapiens-fountain-pen-midnight-in-florence-limited-edition,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-1.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-5.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-6.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-7.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-2.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-3.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-4.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-8.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-11.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-9.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-10.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-stock2.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-HomoSapiens-MidnightinFlorence-stock1.jpg?v=1555960631', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ALL-Visconti-23kt-Large-EF-ST_de48e636-630c-4de1-9b96-2b2ada5f02a2.jpg?v=1556071271']",2019-02-27 13:44:38-05:00

<p>The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neonÂ blue fountain penÂ features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, andÂ it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.</p>
<p>Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.</p>
<p>The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.</li>
<li>Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.</li>
<li>Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.</li>
<li>New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.</li>
<li>New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.</li>

<p><strong></strong>Legend has it that the president of Esterbrook loved exotic cars. That is why in 1964 the Phaeton 300 was born, offering a sleek fountain pen with a hooded nib. Originally offered as a gift set for Christmas, these pens became a highly sought-after prize in the pen collecting world. The Esterbrook Phaeton rides out into the market once more; reborn as the Phaeton 300R. <br><br> The New Phaeton 300R fountain pen is made using 1960âs inspired acrylic colors specially produced for Esterbrook. This black resin pen features a gold-plated hooded nib in medium, and uses a removable plunger style filling system. You can also remove the piston mechanism and fill it via eyedropper if you prefer. A brushed chrome metal cap with gold plated clip adds style to this iconic Esterbrook revival.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaeton-Black-4.jpg?v=1556556101,esterbrook-phaeton-300r-fountain-pen-midnight-black,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaeton-Black-4.jpg?v=1556556101', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaeton-Black-5.jpg?v=1556556101', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaeton-Black-6.jpg?v=1556556101', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaeton-Black-8.jpg?v=1556556101', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaeton-Black-7.jpg?v=1556556101', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaetons-Black-1.jpg?v=1556556101', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaeton-Black-1.jpg?v=1556556106', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaetons-Black-2.jpg?v=1556556101', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Esterbrook-Phaetons-Black-3.jpg?v=1556556101', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/NibNook-Esterbrook-Phaeton-Medium.jpg?v=1556556101']",2018-12-11 14:31:08-05:00

Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Coral resin has orange and red swirls. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a âmirageâ or an optical illusion. It features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.<br><br>Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.â<br><br>This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.</p>
<p>You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><span>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</span></p>

<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>You cannot learn the history of Florence without hearing about the much celebrated Medici family. The family was a noble house that stood out for their political, financial, and cultural influence on the city of Florence. Most of all, the Medici family was known for their passionate contributions to the development of Humanism and the Italian Renaissance. Predominantly bankers, the family owned one of the largest and most respected banks in Europe at the time. The Medici family were avid patrons of the arts and served as the patron for many artists, including Brunelleschi, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. It was during the Mediciâs patronage that da Vinci illustrated Luca Pacioliâs The Divine Proportion which described the formula for geometric relationships that are pleasing to the eye. Thus, this pen is a tribute to one of the greatest dynasties in Italian history.</p>
<p>The Medici pens feature an eight-sided facet design, modeled after the Florentine baptistery, a religious place and symbol of the city's glorious past. The body of the pens are enhanced by the Lily emblem (fleur de lis) engraved on the center band that pays homage to the city of Florence.</p>
<p><span>To capture the essence of the materials used in the Medici villas, Visconti sought out a new material, something that would be reminiscent of these princely Italian mansions. They created a new material by combining acrylic resin and silk fibers and called it Acrosilk.Â </span><span>The Acrosilk in the Medici is deep brown with flecks of a lighter, golden brown, reminiscent of the wood used to construct its namesakeâs luxury villas.</span>Â The Medici family crest is engraved into theÂ gold-plated trim, completing Viscontiâs tribute to the Medicis.</p>
<p>This fountain penÂ comes in a gift box with a manual and is covered by Viscontiâs 2-year warranty.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-10.jpg?v=1547760256,visconti-medici-fountain-pen-rose-gold,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-10.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-11.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-8.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-7.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-12.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-9.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-1.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-2.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-3.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-4.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-5.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Medici-RoseGold-6.jpg?v=1547760256', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ALL-Visconti-23kt-Large-EF-ST_666b37c4-fae8-4cdf-8a83-002aba373e6b.jpg?v=1556071347']",2018-04-05 12:00:00-04:00

<p>The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neonÂ orange<span>Â </span>fountain penÂ features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, andÂ it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.</p>
<p>Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.</p>
<p>The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.</li>
<li>Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.</li>
<li>Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.</li>
<li>New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.</li>
<li>New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</p>

<p><span>Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.</span></p>
<p><strong>UltraResin:</strong></p>
<p><span>Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.</span></p>
<p><span>Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.<br><br>Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.<br><br><b>GlueLess Technology:</b></span></p>
<p><span>To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.<br><br><b>Cap Lock:</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Clip:</b></span></p>
<p><span>A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Band:</b></span></p>
<p><span>Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free.Â <br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Nib:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong>Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineiderâs interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firmâs illustrious name.</span></p>
<p><span>This pen comes with a standard international converter, and also accepts standard international cartridges.Â </span></p>

It features a rose gold-plated quill-shaped clip, and Pineider's ""soft touch magnetic lock"" cap system. This fountain pen fills via cartridge/converter, and is completed with a smooth, soft 14kt rose gold nib. The nib is flexible for ease of creating line width variation in your writing. The elegant packaging also includes a free black leather single pen case (a $75 value), in which you'll find the pen upon initial unboxing. Only 88 of these limited edition pens are available worldwide.<br><br> Following the world trend for flexible nibs, this brand new quill nib is described by Pineider as hyperflex with an excellent memory. The project was made to create a nib for daily writing and not for calligraphy whose performance are quite different. The purpose of the new nib is clear: just writing pleasure for everybody, also for beginners. Remember that the nib is the extension of the hand and does not need any pressure to write.</p>

Completely made in Florence, Italy, this fountain pen features a nice modern design with all new colors. The Aqua resin has beautiful turquoise/blue swirls. The grip section is made of vegetal resin for a comfortable feeling while writing. The fluidity of the pen is disrupted by hollowed grooves in the body, giving the feel of a âmirageâ or an optical illusion. It features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, and it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.<br><br>Visconti is a brand leader in the design and production of pens that use colors and shapes to reference art, and technological know-how in the treatment of color shades, such as the iconic Rembrandt and Van Gogh collections. The Mirage collection takes another step ahead: even its name declares that art is also a wonderful illusion, not just an imitation, that beauty can be a mirage, of which we can enjoy. This pen is made in a material whose reflections, highlighted by the hollows which originate continuous light effects, create an elusive and illusive object. It is modern in its iridescent lightness: like a great artist Marcel Duchamp declared more than 50 years ago: ""Let's enjoy with the beauty of the mirage, because this is what remains to us.â<br><br>This Mirage pen introduces, in addition to a new shape with a modern design, two important innovations for the Visconti production: a new clip, whose manufacturing accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object, and the My Pen System which is not on the cap, but on the bottom of the body, in order to leave in a full view the style of the clip, which ""cuts"" the cap with its metal structure.</p>
<p>You can customize this pen with the magnetized MyPen System. We offer natural stones that you can swap into the finial in place of the Visconti logo coin.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><span>We do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</span></p>

<p><span>Pineider is pleased to introduce the 2019 Avatar collection, designed by Dante Del Vecchio. The Avatar is a pen that marks a step ahead in pen manufacturing through the use of a revolutionary UltraResin, a new GlueLess assembly process, and a special cap lock design that provides extra protection.</span></p>
<p><strong>UltraResin:</strong></p>
<p><span>Over the last 100 years, the solution to pen breakages has come from the incredible features of celluloid, the sole material able to join incredible beauty and a very high resistance to hits. In the 1920's, fountain pen makers would throw pens from an airplane to demonstrate the resistance of celluloid to impacts. Unfortunately, celluloid has poor heat resistance and can easily crystallize with age (that rapidly leads to the complete loss of the pen), and it is extremely difficult to make.</span></p>
<p><span>Introducing UltraResin, a special formula of mother of pearl compound resin developed in Florence for Pineider. This compound is very stiff and its exceptional features makes it far better than celluloid for the creation of fine fountain pens. UltraResin is extremely rigid (nearly like metal), incredibly resistant to hits, and very close to unbreakable. UltraResin is also resistant to oils, inks, electricity, to high and low temperatures, to UV rays, to any weathering condition.<br><br>Pineider technicians made this material suitable for luxury products with an extremely glossy surface and it can feature a mother of pearl look with marbleized colors, a deep black, or even a clear effect.<br><br><b>GlueLess Technology:</b></span></p>
<p><span>To produce the new Avatar, a new assembly technology has been developed called GlueLess. Thanks to 3D engineering and high precision manufacturing, the Avatar is assembled without using a single drop of glue. A technological puzzle but one where every component fits precisely and securely together with just simple framed parts.<br><br><b>Cap Lock:</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Avatar closes via a magnetic twist cap that has been designed to last. A film over the internal magnet functions to protect the magnet from corrosion and allows a soft touch closure.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Clip:</b></span></p>
<p><span>A sophisticated solid marine steel clip is comprised from an inner spring mechanism built in the cap top of the pen.</span></p>
<p><span><b>Band:</b></span></p>
<p><span>Finely engraved and inspired from the skyline of Florence, the trim is palladium plated and nickel free.Â <br></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Nib:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong></strong>Rhodium-plated #6 size steel nib with a new futuristic Pineider engraved logo.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span>Just like an avatar becomes a virtual alter ego for an individual, this pen is designed to serve as an inseparable lifestyle companion. The rounded form and vibrant color represents the dynamic vitality of youth. The marine steel clip is Pineiderâs interpretation of a goose quill, sturdy yet flexible. While each pen is designed to become the alter ego of its owner, Pineider designed the centerband to be the avatar of the city it has proudly called home for the last 240 years, Florence, in honor of the love and affection all Florentines have for the firmâs illustrious name.</span></p>
<p><span>This pen comes with a standard international converter, and also accepts standard international cartridges.Â </span></p>

During long writing sessions, leave the shut-off valve open to take advantage of the impressive ink capacity.</span></p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-1.jpg?v=1551990051,opus-88-omar-fountain-pen-brown,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-1.jpg?v=1551990051', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-2.jpg?v=1551990051', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-3.jpg?v=1551990051', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-4.jpg?v=1551990051', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-5.jpg?v=1551990051', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-6.jpg?v=1551990051', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-7.jpg?v=1551990129', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-8.jpg?v=1551990134', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-11.jpg?v=1551990140', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-OMAR-Brown-13.jpg?v=1551990144', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Nibs2_1a4f4c0f-9827-4936-88ae-afd9b54f5110.jpg?v=1556229816', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Opus88-Nibs_cb7001f2-8184-48b7-a395-f2f77f33fca8.jpg?v=1556229821', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ALL-Jowo-6-Steel-Opus88.jpg?v=1556229837']",2019-03-05 13:45:47-05:00

<p><strong></strong>The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.</p>
<p>This tortoise brown resin fountain pen has chrome trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. <br><br>Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.</p>

<p><em></em>The new limited edition Visconti Torpedo pays homage to the design of fast cars, with its sleek shape and unique materials. The body is made from unidirectional carbon fiber, and the barrel has a palladium-plated overlay. An oversized ink window allows you to see your ink in the barrel, filled via Visconti's double reservoir power filler. This fountain pen is completed with an oversized 23k Palladium Dreamtouch nib, and is limited to 388 pieces worldwide.<br><br> The pen is inspired by a recent design trend, Bolidismo, born in Italy in the mid-80s by a group of architects and designers who largely attended the Faculty of Architecture of the University of Florence. The founding values of the group were the dynamism of the shapes, somehow a far recall to the Futurism of the early twentieth century, and the reference to design (which strongly influenced the world of cars) and to the Comics strip of the '30s. The Torpedo's name alludes both to the model of car in use from the beginning of the last century up to the 30s (again featuring sleek and sporting shape), and to the English term for torpedo and obvious example of a shape designed by the need for speed). Torpedo therefore, ranks fully in the tradition of the Italian design, here even more specifically Florentine, and it claims its value acknowledged worldwide.<br><br> The Torpedo, designed in an ogival shape, dynamic and aerodynamic, interrupted only by the clip, integrates in an original way the two traditional aesthetic codes of Visconti's high-end pens: the skeleton processing, and the transparency of the demo models. Above the carbon fiber of the barrel, there is a light metal cover that surrounds two transparent openings which allows the user to see the internal filing system and the ink. The transparent acrylic resin has been worked in such a way as to be aligned with the carbon fiber and not to be at a lower level, thus contributing to the fluidity of the design.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-1.jpg?v=1554305738,visconti-torpedo-fountain-pen-limited-edition,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-1.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-2.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-3.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-4.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-5.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-6.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-7.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-8.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-CorrectNib-9.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-stockIG-1.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/ARTH-MCEscher_DayAndNight_85289b93-173f-4cfd-8f49-88706aec7352.jpg?v=1557753922', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-stock1_1_f8086bf3-441c-49e7-baa8-1ebe0f4d41bb.jpg?v=1554305738', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Visconti-Torpedo-stock2_1_d0e0479b-2524-457c-85c6-5664000855d4.jpg?v=1554305738']",2018-06-08 14:02:22-04:00

<p>The Breeze launches as Visconti's newest entry level price point, a considerable achievement considering that the pen is entirely made in Visconti's factory in Florence, Italy. This neonÂ yellow fountain penÂ features Viscontiâs new steel nib which writes beautifully. A converter is included, andÂ it also accepts standard international short or long cartridges.</p>
<p>Available in 6 fluorescent colors, the Breeze makes a bold statement, with its outstanding performance and affordable price. Visconti was inspired to create an innovative and stylish luxury writing instrument at a more accessible price point for the new generation of pen lovers that demand style, quality and functionality in a pen. The result is a truly outstanding writing instrument. A collection with a modern edge and as its name implies, the Breeze offers a fresh perspective. The collection is available in six new vibrant color palettes: Cherry, Mandarin, Lemon, Lime, Blueberry and Plum.</p>
<p>The shape of the Breeze reminds us of Visconti's iconic torpedo design, used in pens such as the Rembrandt and original Van Gogh, but with a few notable differences. Visconti has added some unique new and improved features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pen band: The name of the pen is beautifully engraved on the band. For the first time, Visconti has added the band to the pen's body giving a fresh new look.</li>
<li>Pen grip: The grip is made from vegetal resin, the same material as the pen itself. This offers a comfortable writing experience and additional aesthetic appeal with no interruption between the pen's body and cap.</li>
<li>Magnetic closure: The security of the magnetic locking system has been further improved with guidance grooves, resulting in a cap that does not rotate or move once capped.</li>
<li>New steel nib: German made, smooth and precise to write with. The design has the perfect amount of width variation between nib sizes. Available in fine, medium, and broad.</li>
<li>New clip: Visconti has re-engineered its iconic pen clip, to give the same stylish look with improved functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that we do our best to photograph the pens to show how they will appear in person, but due to the nature of the material, expect some variation in the pattern from what you see here.</p>

<p><strong></strong>The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.</p>
<p>This oversized black resin fountain pen has gold trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German gold-plated steel nib. <br><br>Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.</p>

<p><span>Fiery red stands out against the coal-black on the Montegrappa Game of Thrones Targaryen fountain pen. House Targaryen ruled Westeros for three centuries before the rebellion that put Robert Baratheon on the Iron Throne. The house sigil is a three-headed dragon, although the fountain pen only displays one. The dragon represented is appropriately a European-style dragon. You can find it both on the clip and on the finial, where the houseâs motto, ""Fire and Blood,"" can be found.Â </span></p>

<p><strong></strong>The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.</p>
<p>This black resin fountain pen has chrome trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. <br><br>Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933. The interchangeable nibs gave the user many options for writing, whether in school, business, personal etc. Today, a similar system is reborn with the Estie and the specially engineered MV Nib Adaptor (sold separately). The MV adaptor delivers a vintage nib experience with a modern shape Esterbrook pen. You can fit any vintage Esterbrook nib unit into this adaptor, and use it with your modern Estie fountain pen.</p>

<p><strong></strong>The Esterbrook Pen Company, a true American Original, is rewriting its long success story in modern times with a fresh new pen collection based on a complete rebranding. The first new collection is called Estie, a modern day nickname for the brand and a symbol of 1930s nostalgia. The Estie has a clean and understated design with a ringless center and a sleek and narrow pocket clip. The Estie fountain pen is available in a vintage palette of colors.</p>
<p>This oversized black resin fountain pen has chrome trim and has a cushion cap closure. It can be inked with either standard international cartridge or converter (both included) and is equipped with the respected #6 JOWO German steel nib. <br><br>Esterbrook began manufacturing nibs in the US in the mid 1800s, but the 1930s were a period of importance, as they introduced their first interchangeable nib system in 1933.

<p><em>From Visconti:</em></p>
<p>A bet, or better a challenge: this is in brief the birth of the new Visconti Pentagon pen. A reference to the clean but imposing and solid surfaces of Empire-style furniture, without inlays but enriched by the presence of clear metallic decorations, combined to the formal values from which one of the most iconic lines of Visconti production is born, the Divina collection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Golden Number: the proportion between the length of the cap and the body tends to the divine proportion, maintaining that percentage of imprecision which is proper of human nature.</li>
<li>The Pentagram: the pentagonal section, which characterizes the pen itself, converges into the pure shape of circumference at both ends.</li>
<li>The Nautilus or ""Spirale d'oro"": according to the Fibonacci formula, spiral is here developed and spread in a harmonious movement which fades to the circles of tops of the cap and the blind cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements merge, like for Divina, in an alchemy of shapes and proportions, in a pen that can be defined elegant but static, powerful: its antiquity, like the one of the Roman and Greek temples, is timeless, so deeply hidden today in our culture that it can be confused with humanity itself.<br><br> The pentagon, which the pen is built on, contributes to define it as a solid, delimited object, capable of a static equilibrium: this let the pen balance on a plane without rolling also without the cap (uniquely within the current collection).<br><br>At the same time, the clip determines an orientation, a directionality in its static symmetry, favoring one of the five sides over others and thus introducing a hidden dynamism: if rotated on its longitudinal axis, the Pentagon changes continuously, looking unusually asymmetric.</p>

The delicate and fine depiction and three-dimensional aspect overflowing with a strong power of expression are the special characteristics of this collection. Since Chinkin is a carving technique, there is no room for mistakes. Every single carve is a true challenge in the sense of the word.</p>

Since their founding by Shunichi Nakata,Â they've lived out their mission of taking part in the Japanese writing culture by creating high quality and innovative writing instruments.</p>
<p>Founding a company that bears the word ""platinum"", regarded as the king of metals,Â Mr.Â Nakata aspired to create ""the king of fountain pens"" that used a platinum nib. After repeated trial and error, the ""Platinum Platinum"" was finally brought to life in 1967 as the world's first fountain pen to have such a nib. The pen body was made of sterling silver, and was the inspiration for this anniversary edition pen.Â </p>
<p>Now half a century later,Â the pen has been reimagined. ""The Prime"" is made of solidÂ silver, with an applied lattice pattern which features grooves filled with black ink. It features theÂ latest 3776 Century nibÂ design and includesÂ theirÂ proprietary Slip &amp; Seal Mechanism, which keeps ink wet in the pen for up to two years.</p>
<p>This penÂ is the culmination of Platinum Penâs history, and will beÂ released as a limited edition of only 2,000 pieces worldwide. The rhodium-plated 14kt nib features a special 100th anniversary logo, and the penÂ is engraved with the serial number. It is presented in a gift boxÂ and comes with a 60ml Blue-Black ink bottle, a Blue-Black ink cartridge, a chrome converter, a 100th anniversary pen stand, and a 100th anniversary commemorative book.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-1.jpg?v=1551125443,platinum-century-the-prime-fountain-pen-silver-limited-edition,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-1.jpg?v=1551125443', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-2.jpg?v=1551125447', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-3.jpg?v=1551125451', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-4.jpg?v=1551125456', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-5.jpg?v=1551125460', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-6.jpg?v=1551125464', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-7.jpg?v=1551125488', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-8.jpg?v=1551125496', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-9.jpg?v=1551125502', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-10.jpg?v=1551125506', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-11.jpg?v=1551125516', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-12.jpg?v=1551125526', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-13.jpg?v=1551125532', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-14.jpg?v=1551125537', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-15.jpg?v=1551125544', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-16.jpg?v=1551125549', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-17.jpg?v=1551125554', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Silver-LE-18.jpg?v=1551125558', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-ThePrime-Silver-stock6.jpg?v=1551125432']",2019-02-26 10:42:20-05:00

Inspired by the Fortuna Copper Mule, this Mini Mule fountain pen has been engineered to use smaller #5 steel nibs, taking a standard convertor or cartridges just like conventional Fortuna models. <br><br> The new Mini Mule shares the same anti-microbial properties as its older sibling, as well as the patina and imperfections unique to copper. Like a Travelerâs Company notebook, its changing appearance records the places it has been. Owners will thrill as they observe it aging gracefully with use. A true workhorse! <br><br> The Mule program, and the creation of the Montegrappa Mule by Bassanoâs own Danieli Bar have provided one of the most warmly received Montegrappa stories of recent years, attracting interest from lifestyle and cuisine editors. The Mini Mule arrives in a standard case that includes the recipe for the famous cocktail. <br><br> As well as bringing a fresh, rootsy finish to the Fortuna silhouette, Muleâs honest rustic charm and gastronomic credentials have resonated with younger, hipster-inclined shoppers. With the arrival of the Mini Mule, we can turn up the charm and offer more to intrepid urban travelers, women and fans of every day carry (EDC). <br><br> The Copper MuleÂ features a copper barrel with brushed stainless steel accents, creating an elegant yet modern look. The pen features a super smooth steel nib, and accepts cartridges or a converter (included). The copper will patina on the pen over time (unless polished - cloth included), creating a unique look to you.<br><br> Since 1912, for more than a century, Montegrappa has been manufacturing high-quality writing instruments in the same historic building in Bassano del Grappa, North East Italy. Within a stoneâs throw of the Montegrappa works â home of the oldest pen manufacture in Italy â is the heart of another industry. Grappa is the local tipple, and it has never been more popular, finding new friends in bars and saloons from Mumbai to Manhattan to Macau. Following the success of the spectacular limited edition Grappa pen in hammered copper, Montegrappa again honors the localsâ favorite beverage with a pen inspired by both the drink and the equipment that distills it. <br><br> Featuring a shape that is classic Montegrappa, curvaceous yet sleekly contemporary, the Montegrappa Mule pen collection further displays its familial links with a cap top bearing the famous ""1912"" logo, while the nib is embellished with a filigree Montegrappa pattern. The cap and barrel are crafted in mirror-polished copper, further defined by a brushed silver-plated trim. The effect recalls the well-used, vintage piping and tubing employed in the process of producing grappa. Over the time, each Montegrappa Mule will acquire its own unique patina through handling by its fond owner, truly personalizing the writing instrument. Easily recyclable without any loss of property, copper is a naturally hygienic metal that slows down the growth of germs. It is widely used in food preparation and health equipment, as well as in design and various artistic forms.<br><br> Merely honoring the grappa tradition would be enough to explain the design of the Montegrappa Mule, but Montegrappaâs creativity has been imbued with the spirit of the â¦ spirit! Initially inspired by the classic Moscow Mule cocktail, traditionally served in a copper mug, Montegrappa has registered an exciting new grappa-based cocktail. Created by famous Bassano-based mixologists, brothers Edoardo and Leone Miotti, the recipe is specially developed and already featured on the cocktail menu of Bar Danieli. The Montegrappa Mule will be sipped with relish during the promotion of the pen at various sippingânâsampling bar and in-store events. The drink itself is made of 40Â° premium-quality grappa, bergamot scents and a habanero-chilli pepper twist.</p>

<p><em>From Visconti:</em></p>
<p>A bet, or better a challenge: this is in brief the birth of the new Visconti Pentagon pen. A reference to the clean but imposing and solid surfaces of Empire-style furniture, without inlays but enriched by the presence of clear metallic decorations, combined to the formal values from which one of the most iconic lines of Visconti production is born, the Divina collection.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Golden Number: the proportion between the length of the cap and the body tends to the divine proportion, maintaining that percentage of imprecision which is proper of human nature.</li>
<li>The Pentagram: the pentagonal section, which characterizes the pen itself, converges into the pure shape of circumference at both ends.</li>
<li>The Nautilus or ""Spirale d'oro"": according to the Fibonacci formula, spiral is here developed and spread in a harmonious movement which fades to the circles of tops of the cap and the blind cap.</li>
</ul>
<p>These elements merge, like for Divina, in an alchemy of shapes and proportions, in a pen that can be defined elegant but static, powerful: its antiquity, like the one of the Roman and Greek temples, is timeless, so deeply hidden today in our culture that it can be confused with humanity itself.<br><br> The pentagon, which the pen is built on, contributes to define it as a solid, delimited object, capable of a static equilibrium: this let the pen balance on a plane without rolling also without the cap (uniquely within the current collection).<br><br>At the same time, the clip determines an orientation, a directionality in its static symmetry, favoring one of the five sides over others and thus introducing a hidden dynamism: if rotated on its longitudinal axis, the Pentagon changes continuously, looking unusually asymmetric.</p>

It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), and depicts two dragons, one on the cap and one on the barrel. Raden abalone shells accent the background. This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create.<br><br> Enthralled by the intriguing beauty of the mythical creatures, Namiki beautifully captures the magnificence and quintessence of the Dragon. Fearsome and powerful, dragons are also considered benevolent and the bringers of wealth and good fortune. In Japanese mythology, the dragon is highly-regarded as the Guardian of the East and symbolizes strength, power and protection. It is also known a symbol of fertility, wealth and success.<br><br> There are two types of Japanese dragons; one belonging to the sky while the other is found in bodies of water, and as such is reflected in the cap and body of this pen. The sky dragon depicted on the cap of the fountain pen is seen fiercely guarding the pearl within its three-clawed grasp, believed to be the wish-fulfilling pearl jewel. The magic ball is also known as Cintamani, a sacred stone that gives power and makes its possessor's wishes come true. As the dragon is endowed with supernatural powders, it is also usually linked to water. Thus the dragon in the air uses the Cintamani power to attract rain in the spring and avoid floods in the fall.<br><br> The Taka Maki-e technique helps to accentuate the awesome presence of the two auspicious dragons. Waves and clouds are treated with silver Taka Maki-e creating the perfect contrast with these golden dragons.

This characteristic model adds yet another family of high-quality writing instruments to LAMY's premium assortment, uniting modern, functional design with a luxurious writing experience.</p>
<p>The trademark of the LAMY Imporium series is its prominent straight-lined body structure and grip. The cylindrically designed smooth cap with solid, high-gloss clip provides a striking contrast. The combination of playful details and consistent reduction gives this model its unmistakable appearance.</p>
<p>The fountain pensÂ are refined and partially galvanized with an especially high-quality PVD coating. From the nib to the clip â only first-classÂ metals are used: gold, platinum, or titanium. One special highlight of the pen is the PVD-refined bicolor 14kt gold nib which guarantees a uniquely soft writing experience and is available in different nib widths.</p>
<p>The LAMY imporium was designed by Mario Bellini, one of the most distinguished designers of the last 30 years. He was one of the first living designers after Charles Eames to ever receive the honor of having a solo exhibition in the MOMA New York.</p>
<p>This fountain pen comes in a luxury gift box, aÂ LAMY ink cartridge, and a Z27 converter for use with bottled ink so you can get started writing right away.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>To ensure quality performance, LAMY tests their pens as a final step in manufacturing. If you happen to see any residual blue ink, rest assured that this is normal.</p>

It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), as well as Rankaku (quail shells). This fountain pen has a 18k gold nib in the massive #50 size. The large capacity barrel fills with ink via eyedropper, and the pen comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink. Each pen takes months to create.<br><br> In the Japanese culture, the owl, or ""Fukuro"", means luck and protection from hardship or suffering. Using ebonite as its base, the Rankaku Maki-e is used to design both the owls on the pen, and the Raden technique is used to embed the eyes of the owls making them sparkle. A layer of clear urushi lacquer is then used to protect the surface of the pen giving it a glossy polish. The Rankaku artwork is simply outstanding with the incredible attention to detail.<br><br> Two owls can be seen on the pen. The owl on the cap is perched on a Quercusserate tree, showcasing the nocturnal birdâs exceptional ability in seeking out its prey in the still of the night. The owl in the barrel is depicted silently flapping its wings and swooping in for the kill.<br><br> The Rankaku technique is a unique method whereby the motifs are designed using the powder or small pieces of quail shells. They are fixed into the lacquer and later coated with another layer of lacquer. The layer of lacquer is then burnished to reveal the design of the pen. The Raden technique, on the other hand, is a technique whereby the stratum of various abalone shells are peeled into thin layers. Then they are cut into small pieces before being coated with urushi lacquer to hold them in place. The urushi is then burnished to create a finish.<br><br> As these pens are truly one-of-a-kind pieces of art, they are warrantied for life by Namiki.<br><br> <i>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

<p><em></em>Raden is a traditional Japanese decorative craft mainly used for lacquer ware and woodwork. By working with small stripes of precious shell material, the artist of the Raden pen creates a beautiful, impressive piece of art. Each piece is truly unique.</p>
<p>The first step to create the fountain pen Raden M805 Royal Platinum is to give the surface a deep black impression by using the special Japanese Urushi lacquer. Then the typical stripes are made with particles from the precious white mother of pearl shell. A platinum foil is carefully affixed one by one to the backside of the stripes. In the next step, the stripes are fixed to the cap and barrel by a coating of lacquer. Finally, the artist individually signs and numbers each fountain pen with the Maki-e technique, which used to be reserved exclusively for Japanese Royals as an indication of their power.</p>
<p>With the limited edition Raden series, Pelikan applies this wonderful Japanese decorative craft to fountain pen models of its famous SouverÃ¤nÂ® series. The Raden M805 Royal Platinum fountain pens are pieces of art with finely-chased and completely rhodanized 18kt gold nib in medium only. Each piston-filling fountain pen is encased in a traditional Japanese gift box which is made of Paulownia wood. The Raden M805 Royal Platinum is available in a limited edition of 388 pieces worldwide.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-6.jpg?v=1543953027,pelikan-m805-fountain-pen-raden-royal-platinum-limited-edition,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-6.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-1.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-5.jpg?v=1543953032', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-7.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-8.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-4.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-3.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-9.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-2.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-10.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RoyalPlatinum-11.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RadenRoyalPlatinumLE-stock2.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RadenRoyalPlatinumLE-stock4.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RadenRoyalPlatinumLE-stock3.jpg?v=1543953027', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Pelikan-M805-RadenRoyalPlatinumLE-stock1.jpg?v=1543953027']",2018-09-27 10:10:47-04:00

It features the Togidashi-Taka Maki-e technique (burnished-raised maki-e), depicting frogs, leaves, and water designs. The pen has an 18k gold nib in size #20, fills via cartridge/converter (a CON-70 is included), and comes packaged in a wooden box with a bottle of ink.<br><br> Extraordinary artistry and craftsmanship, along with superior attention to detail, embody the essence of the Japanese Maki-e art form. The exquisite hyper-realistic, animal inspired design of the Yukari Royale Frog is brought to life through the thousands of skillful touches of the master artisan. The artisan started with drawing the intricate lines of the frogs, leaves and water designs on the lustrous black Urushi lacquer surface, and then skillfully sprinkled 18-karat gold foil and powder in a continuous manner creating a dimensional, powerful and expressive masterpiece.<br><br> Captured stunningly on the body of the fountain pen, the artisan has expressed the passage of time by portraying a variety of flowers that come into bloom at different times throughout the year. The tranquil flow of water is expressed with luminous Raden (Mother-of-pearl) and Kawari-nuir. Also among the carefully curated scene are three golden frogs dynamically depicted moving around in a lively manner. Frogs in Japanese, also referred to as âkaeru,â are known to be a popular motif as a lucky charm that will bring health, longevity, protection and wealth. <br><br> Each year, after hibernating, the frog has the peculiarity to go back to the pond of its birth, whatever the distance, for reproduction. Its name in Japanese (kaeru) is pronounced the same way as the word, which means return. This characteristic has made it a protective animal for travelers (often as protective amulets) and the symbol of hospitality. Symbol of fertility, because it lays numerous eggs in one go, the frog is also the one of happy returns of any kind, chance, age, happiness, money, etc. It is also thought to give the power of attracting wealth (it was the emblem of the tax collectors in feudal times). At last, it represents resurrection and metamorphosis, the perpetual transformation of man.<br><br>Please allow us up to several extra days for shipping of this pen.

It can walk on grass yet not trample the blades, and it can also walk on water. As it is a peaceful creature, its diet does not include flesh. It takes great care when it walks never to harm or tread on any living thing, and it is said to appear only in areas ruled by a wise and benevolent leader (some say even if this area is only a house). It is normally gentle but can become fierce if a pure person is threatened by a sinner, spouting flames from its mouth and exercising other fearsome powers that vary from story to story.<br><br> Legends tell that the Kylin has appeared in the garden of the legendary Huangdi and in the capital of Emperor Yao.

The Medici is the perfect combination of innovative materials and proven designs.<br><br>You cannot learn the history of Florence without hearing about the much celebrated Medici family. The family was a noble house that stood out for their political, financial, and cultural influence on the city of Florence. Most of all, the Medici family was known for their passionate contributions to the development of Humanism and the Italian Renaissance. Predominantly bankers, the family owned one of the largest and most respected banks in Europe at the time. The Medici family were avid patrons of the arts and served as the patron for many artists, including Brunelleschi, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. It was during the Mediciâs patronage that da Vinci illustrated Luca Pacioliâs The Divine Proportion which described the formula for geometric relationships that are pleasing to the eye. Thus, this pen is a tribute to one of the greatest dynasties in Italian history.</p>
<p>The Medici pens feature an eight-sided facet design, modeled after the Florentine baptistery, a religious place and symbol of the city's glorious past. The body of the pens are enhanced by the Lily emblem (fleur de lis) engraved on the center band that pays homage to the city of Florence.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><span>To capture the essence of the materials used in the Medici villas, Visconti sought out a new material, something that would be reminiscent of these princely Italian mansions. They created a new material by combining acrylic resin and silk fibers and called it Acrosilk. The Acrosilk in the Medici isÂ blue withÂ swirlsÂ of yellow.Â </span>The beautiful colors of the Medici Dynasty collection emulate the semi-precious stone mosaics that embellish the Medici villas. The Medici family crest is engraved into theÂ gold-plated trim, completing Viscontiâs tribute to the Medicis.</p>

Trimmed withÂ yellow gold, this regular edition fountain pen utilizes Viscontiâs power filler mechanism and is fitted with an oversized 23k Palladium Dreamtouch nib plated inÂ yellow gold. The Medici is the perfect combination of innovative materials and proven designs.<br><br>You cannot learn the history of Florence without hearing about the much celebrated Medici family. The family was a noble house that stood out for their political, financial, and cultural influence on the city of Florence. Most of all, the Medici family was known for their passionate contributions to the development of Humanism and the Italian Renaissance. Predominantly bankers, the family owned one of the largest and most respected banks in Europe at the time. The Medici family were avid patrons of the arts and served as the patron for many artists, including Brunelleschi, Donatello, Raphael, Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. It was during the Mediciâs patronage that da Vinci illustrated Luca Pacioliâs The Divine Proportion which described the formula for geometric relationships that are pleasing to the eye. Thus, this pen is a tribute to one of the greatest dynasties in Italian history.</p>
<p>The Medici pens feature an eight-sided facet design, modeled after the Florentine baptistery, a religious place and symbol of the city's glorious past. The body of the pens are enhanced by the Lily emblem (fleur de lis) engraved on the center band that pays homage to the city of Florence.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p><span>To capture the essence of the materials used in the Medici villas, Visconti sought out a new material, something that would be reminiscent of these princely Italian mansions. They created a new material by combining acrylic resin and silk fibers and called it Acrosilk. The Acrosilk in the Medici isÂ black withÂ swirlsÂ of yellow.Â </span>The beautiful colors of the Medici Dynasty collection emulate the semi-precious stone mosaics that embellish the Medici villas. The Medici family crest is engraved into theÂ gold-plated trim, completing Viscontiâs tribute to the Medicis.</p>

It represents one of mankindâs greatest achievements, defining the USA as the victor in the space race with an accomplishment to rank with Christopher Columbus discovering the New World. Inspired by the Apollo 11 mission that delivered astronauts to the lunar surface, in a licensed collaboration with NASA, Montegrappa has reproduced the iconic Saturn V rocket, interpreted as a writing instrument.<br><br>The Moon Landing CollectionÂ is made in white pearlised resin with sterling silver trim, adorned with enamel to reproduce a three-dimensional trompe-lâÅil effect of the rocket bodyâs First, Second and Third ""stages"". <br><br>Around the First Stage are the legend ""USA"" the American national flag, laser-cut and enamel-filled in exquisite detail. A semi-detachable barrel allows users to simulate the separation of the second and third stages of the Saturn V rocket, and reveal special viewing windows that expose the penâs internal ink flux mechanism. Both features are designed to heighten the experience of an object made to appeal to inquisitive, playful minds.</p>
<p>The pen cap is structured to represent the Second Stage and the Apollo command module, with the silver ""lost-wax"" signature clip, cast in the form of the stairway structure supporting the rocket. Completing the realization of a Saturn V in miniature, the blind cap is reproduced with the exhaust nozzles of the engines of the space-craft, detailed with red enamel. The pocket clip recalls the tower crane of the Cape Kennedy launch pad, while its blindcap features the conical rocket thrusters that supplied the Saturn V with an incredible 160 million horsepower. <br><br> The fountain pen is piston-fed, and its nib is crafted in 18k gold.

The unique pattern is made using a hydro dipping marbling technique - the swirling color dyes are floated on the surface of a solution, then each pen is dipped in, transferring the pattern onto the body of the pen. A protective coatingÂ is then placed on the marbled pen. No two are exactly alike!</p>
<p>The AeroÂ has a satisfying soft sliding click cap that posts securely onto the barrel when writing. It features a smooth writing #6 JoWo stainless steel nib or two-tone 14kt gold nib, a dark grey grip and trim, and fills via standard international cartridge/converter (both are included).</p>
<p>Due to the unique manufacturing process, there is at least one point on every pen where a small gap or overlap in the pattern could occur. These vary in severity, location, and subtlety and are to be expected with this Volute design.</p>
<p>Here's an explanation from Diplomat on how this unique finish is applied:</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 30px;""><em>Always looking for surprising and innovative effects for our range, Diplomat is proud to propose the new Volute.</em><br><br><em>Aero Volute is the result of our research for possibilities to apply detailed and colorful decoration on our metal pens.</em><br><br><em>For this, we used Hydro dipping or so called water transfer printing technology. This technique made big evolutions for the last years and is used mainly today for personalization, not in industrial series.</em><br><br><em>As you can see with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIHOr9i4OjE"" target=""_blank"" title=""Hydro Dipping Examples"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">this link for examples video</a>, painted decoration is applied by water solution.</em><br><br><em>A film with the decoration to be transferred is carefully placed on the waterâs surface in a dipping tank. This clear film is water soluble and dissolves after applying an activator solution.</em><br><br><em>Once dipping is begun, the surface tension of the water will allow the pattern to curve around any shape. The ink adheres and will not wash off.</em><br><br><em>In order to have good quality and resistance there are some preparation steps of the surface and finishing steps too, using appropriate clear lacquer. Even more, a real know how for the use of the activator, a perfect dipping technic are requiredâ¦.all this for an amazing result full of colors and details.</em><br><br><em>We chose this Volute pattern to demonstrate the quality of the details, the respect of the shades of black and provide to the Aero a real different personality.</em><br><br><em>In a reference to smoke volutes, this aerial design fits the spirit of Aero.</em><br><br><em>Not used in our writing instrument industry, this kind of decoration and technology enhanced Diplomat modernism through our Flagship Aero and our capacity to surprise our partners and consumers.</em></p>

<p>Bishamon-ten, also known as ""Tamonten"", is unique among the Japanese Seven Gods of Good Fortune, as he was originally thought to be a war god by <em>Samurai</em>, since he took the form of a military commander. After the<em>Â </em><em>Edo</em> Period (1603-1868 A.D.), he came to be worshipped by those in need of an advantage in a competition of chance. Bishamon-ten is now regarded as the god of financial good fortune.</p>
<p>The fountain pen is adorned with an image of Bishamon-ten holding a trident in his right hand and a stupa, or structure that contains relics and is often used as a place of meditation, in his left hand. He is also stomping on an evil demon, with a halo emanating from his head, resulting in a powerful depiction of this mighty god.Â </p>
<p>The red ink echoes the color of the flames, depicted on the fountain pen, emanating from the halo that is floating behind him.</p>

<p><em>From Namiki:<br><br></em>Having reached the major milestone of their 100th anniversary, we planned âthe Japanese Seven Gods of Good Fortuneâ, which gathered together the comprehensive master skills of the KOKKOKAI Maki-e artisansâ group. KOKKOKAI is an artisansâ group that formed in 1931, around a âLiving National Treasure,â the late Gonroku Matsuda (1896â1986 A.D.), who was the highest authority on Maki-e. Coming from inside and outside the company, Maki-e artisans who inherited Matsudaâs intentions are even now producing lacquer-based artworks as members of Kokkokai.Â <br><br>Each known as a god, Ebisu, Daikoku-ten, Bishamon-ten, Benzai-ten, Fuku-roku-ju, Juro-jin and Hotei-son are each depicted in Taka-Maki-e (Raised Maki-e).<br><br>In addition, the 100th anniversary Pilot Iroshizuku bottled inks accompaniedÂ withÂ each penÂ are limited edition in seven colors tailored to the impressions given by each of âthe Japanese Seven Gods of Good Fortuneâ. Each color isÂ associated with the motifs ofÂ its corresponding godâEbisu, Daikoku-ten, Bishamon-ten, Benzai-ten, Fuku-roku-ju, Juro-jin and Hotei-son âsold as Maki-e fountain pens to commemorate the 100th anniversary of PILOTâs foundation. Note: The color concepts of The Japanese Seven Gods of Good Fortune are of PILOTâs own interpretation.<br><br><strong>Ebisu (Light Blue):</strong><br>In ancient times, Ebisu was worshipped as the god of plentiful fishing, and is now regarded as the god of happiness and prosperity who makes everything from businesses to crops plentiful. The light blue ink reflects the color of the sparkling sea, depicted on the fountain pen, around the rock on which Ebisu is sitting.<br><br><strong>Daikoku-ten (Yellow):</strong><br>Daikoku-ten is believed to be the god of treasure as well as happiness, prosperity and better fortune that rules food and wealth. The yellow ink echoes the color of the straw rice-bag, depicted on the fountain pen, upon which Daikoku-ten is sitting.<br><br><strong>Bishamon-ten (Red):</strong><br>Bishamon-ten is believed to be the god of financial good fortune and competition. The red ink echoes the color of the flames, depicted on the fountain pen, emanating from the halo that is floating behind him.<br><br><strong>Benzai-ten (Coral Pink):</strong><br>Benzai-ten is unique amongst the Japanese Seven Gods of Good Fortune, in that she is the only goddess. Today, she is worshipped as the god of wisdom, and is said to represent the virtue that exists in a marriage bond. The coral pink-colored ink echoes the color of the Benzai-tenâs Kimono, depicted on the fountain pen.<br><br><strong>Fuku-roku-ju (Green):</strong><br>Taoismâs three virtues which are the perpetuation of oneâs descendants, health and longevity, are known as Fuku-roku-ju, which in written form is represented with three Chinese characters that make up the godâs name. Today, Fuku-roku-ju is worshipped as the god of personal virtue. The green ink echoes the color of the turtle, depicted on the fountain pen, on which Fuku-roku-ju is riding.<br><br><strong>Juro-jin (Purple):<br></strong>Juro-jin is worshipped as the god of longevity and prolonged life as well as wealth and longevity. The purple ink echoes the color of the Juro-jinâs Kimono, depicted on the fountain pen.<br><br><strong>Hotei-son (Black-Green):<br></strong>Hotei-son is widely regarded as a god of good fortune and matrimonial happiness, believed to impart riches, status and prosperity. The black-green ink echoes the color of Hotei-sonâs necklace, depicted on the fountain pen.</p>

Each year a new and exclusive range tells the tales of epochs and peoples that have shaped the history of humanity. This time itâs the spirit and precision of the samurai that serve as a fascinating source of inspiration for the limited edition of writing instruments.</p>
<meta charset=""utf-8"">
<p>This Samurai Pen of the Year features fascinating elements reminiscent of the Japanese warriors. The dark barrel, made of stained, painted and polished magnolia wood, is adorned with an engraving of Japanese characters, worked by hand in 24-carat gold varnish. It reads: âToday I win against myself of yesterdayâ, a quote from the great samurai warrior Miyamoto Musashi. The end cap is also engraved on the face with the symbol created by Musashi for the word âtsubaâ (hand guard). The tsuba protects the samuraiâs hand while he is using the weapon. The stingray leather with which the samurai covered their swordsâ handles and which they decorated with artistic inlays, is recreated in the hand-forged grip of the Pen of the Year 2019. Both caps, the grip and the 18kt gold nib of the fountain pen are coated with ruthenium.<br><br> Each exclusive writing instrument represents the inner disposition of the samurai to strive for strength, clarity and perfection. The exclusive pen comes in a high-gloss, black wooden case. Each of the 400 unique, individually numbered pens is accompanied by a certificate signed by Count Charles von Faber-Castell, attesting to the authenticity of the limited edition.</p>
<p><br> BUSHI.<br> The samurai, also known as bushi in Japan, became political leaders in the late 12th century and reigned over the country until the abolition of feudalism. Their era came to an end in 1876, when the emperor banned the wearing of their traditional costume with two swords. Yet the myth surrounding the samurai remains to this day. The Japanese warriors continue to impress later generations with their matchless martial arts skills, their swords intricately crafted from the most precious materials and their silently gliding movements, the aesthetics of which may be compared to the motion of writing.<br><br> Å-YOROI.<br> The samurai armour, or Å-yoroi, was crafted with extreme precision to give the warrior the greatest possible freedom in handling his weapons. The armor, elaborately manufactured from metal plates, is invoked in the Black Edition of the Pen of the Year 2019, with its painted black barrel and delicate gold lines.<br><br> NITÃ. <br> Miyamoto Musashi (1584â1645), the greatest samurai warrior of all time, wrote The Book of Five Rings (âGo Rin No Shoâ), which serves as a source of worldly wisdoms to this day and describes the strategies for the perfect samurai. Accordingly, it is not the warriorâs technique that matters most, but his inner attitude characterized by relaxation, openness and wisdom of the heart. Learning and perfecting flowing sequences of motion was part of Musashiâs NitÃ´ swordsmanship school. He compared these sequences with the adaptability and clarity of water, and to this day steady movements are symbolized in Japan by a special wave pattern. <br><br> KATANA.<br> The blades of the long swords (katanas) of the samurai were forged from tamahagane steel in a traditional and complex process, while the sheath and handle were made of untreated magnolia wood and finished with prized stingray leather.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-2.jpg?v=1551365060,graf-von-faber-castell-samurai-pen-of-the-year-2019-fountain-pen,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-2.jpg?v=1551365060', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-1.jpg?v=1551365060', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-3.jpg?v=1551365060', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-4.jpg?v=1551365060', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-5.jpg?v=1551365060', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-6.jpg?v=1551365070', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-7.jpg?v=1551365060', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-8.jpg?v=1551365060', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-9.jpg?v=1551365060', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/GrafVonFaberCastell-POTY-Samurai-10.jpg?v=1551365060']",2019-01-25 14:54:36-05:00

Since their founding by Shunichi Nakata,Â they've lived out their mission of taking part in the Japanese writing culture by creating high quality and innovative writing instruments.</p>
<p>Founding a company that bears the word ""platinum"", regarded as the king of metals,Â Mr.Â Nakata aspired to create ""the king of fountain pens"" that used a platinum nib. After repeated trial and error, the ""Platinum Platinum"" was finally brought to life in 1967 as the world's first fountain pen to have such a nib. The pen body was made of sterling silver, and was the inspiration for this anniversary edition pen.Â </p>
<p>Now half a century later,Â the pen has been reimagined. ""The Prime"" is made of solid platinum, including the body, nib, and trim of the pen. The precise double lattice pattern is intricate and complicated to produce, and is a testament to the high quality, precision, and beauty you expect from Platinum. It features theÂ latest 3776 Century nibÂ design and includesÂ theirÂ proprietary Slip &amp; Seal Mechanism, which keeps ink wet in the pen for up to two years.</p>
<p>This penÂ is the culmination of Platinum Penâs history, and will beÂ released as a limited edition of only 100 pieces. The pure platinum nib features a special 100th anniversary logo, and the crown of the pen is engraved with the serial number. It's presented in a stunning gift box, comes with a 60ml Blue-Black ink bottle, a Blue-Black ink cartridge, a chrome converter, a 100th anniversary pen stand, and a 100th anniversary commemorative book. It's truly a collectors item and one of only three pens available in the US.</p>",//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-1_927d490b-4569-47c0-aae1-f9ddb77f483c.jpg?v=1553823924,platinum-century-the-prime-fountain-pen-platinum-limited-edition,"['//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-1_927d490b-4569-47c0-aae1-f9ddb77f483c.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-2.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-3.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-4.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-5.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-6.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-7.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-8.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-9.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-10.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-11.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-12.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-13_3c63bf39-4c33-4c51-892f-6f066c6f9042.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-14.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-Prime-Platinum-LE-15.jpg?v=1553823924', '//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2603/2528/products/Platinum-ThePrime-Platinum-stock6.jpg?v=1553823924']",2019-02-26 10:42:19-05:00
